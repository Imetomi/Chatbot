Why?
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Well, no...
But
do you listen to this crap?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
But she doesn't want to date.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
You know French?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What makes you think he'll do it?
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Where ya goin?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
It's about time.
You and Verona?
He always look so
What'd he say?
You didn't
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
You don't care if I die
Like you could find one
Why'd you let him get to you?
Dorsey.
Were you in jail?
Start a band?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Good call.
State trooper?
Is that a request or a command?
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
You tell me.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
My grandmother's .
Wait I...
It wasn't like that.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
As a parent, that's my right
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
You can see for yourself.
Are we going to argue?
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
They took everything...
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
What does he say?
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Chief knows.
Colon!
The ocean is uncrossable?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
You bloody...
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... Into a monk...
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
I will if they don't send me back.
I can't take you to my place.
What are you asking me?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
I'm gonna propose.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Two heads.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
You promise?
Thank you.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Are you married?
We are both from Prague.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
I did.
Why not?
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Well, he...
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Hal?
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Fortunately, they did.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
You're in a hurry.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Here you go, baby.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
You're gonna help us take him.
Yeah, I noticed...
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
Last night.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
There.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Yeah?
Which one pulled the trigger?
Who are all these?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Bullshit red tape.
Hey, you're right.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Hey, I don't believe it.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
You're impossible...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
How ya doin'?
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Let her go.
How much?
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
What're you laughing about?
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...would you like a drink?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
He's a she!
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Where's Leeloo?
I don't have time... I need to know.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
30 seconds...
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Is that all?
It's my wife.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Uh...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
This is all that survived?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Is that better?
Wait or act.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Your clothing reeks of it.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
You should have.
Snuff?
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
Excellent.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Celebrity Films.
I want his name.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
I never killed anyone.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Truman Capote.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
... Hello... ?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
How are you?  Having any luck?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
Yes... ?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
What was she running from?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I didn't mean to...
Do you think the police did a good job?
How... how can you say that to me...?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Hello... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
What is this?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't go back to sleep again.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
No...
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
What the hell was that?
Rick, please.
Enough of that crap.
Hey, Rick!
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
What?
What is it?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
Mommy...?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
There you go.  Love you.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Are you alright?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Where are you going?
I don't understand.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
I don't know.
Reef!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Yeah?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Is there any way out of it?
What course, Skipper?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Right <u>at</u> him?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
That's a <u>face</u>???
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
See what?
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You don't believe me?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
No.
Yes.
You see it?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Guaranteed, eh?
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Don't mind if I do.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Where'd you get the blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Saw him do it?
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
But it's not funny now.
I just think you used to be bad.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
It's pretty old.
Pop?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Huh?
You? Why?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Want to buy?
Lillian!
You okay?
You don't mean that.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Take care, Wade.
You talked to Jack?
Rolfe.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Rolfe.
Well, it was an accident.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Got it.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Sir, you threw out page two.
That's affirmative.
How many others killed?
How?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
And all these rooms here?
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
I'll not going without my family.
I miss you. And I miss her.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
One.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
IT'S OPEN!
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Elaine.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine, what's going on?
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, what's happening?!
Can't we change course?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Can I hold him?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Captain Oveur?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
No. No one that I know of.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
Oh, I can't stand it.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Roger.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
You are Cassandra?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Nothing?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Tell me.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
Well, let's roll, George.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
How potent?
We?  You've taken it?
Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
Harcourt is dead.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
What kind of test?
Yeah, Sykes?
How can I go?
What?
Get outta there!
Movement!
Can't lock up...
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
I get the picture.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What is it?
Well you're not reading it right!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Looks like it stung him.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Yes.  A little girl.
Don't go!  Please.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Are we going to sleep now?
Can we dream?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Why not?
Oh!
The marriage!
What did you think of the music?
No! I won't have him back.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
What is it?
Stop it!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Yes.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
What's the matter with you?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
What?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Who was that?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Why not?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Why not?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Then he didn't send you?
This is not his handwriting.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
Behold!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
A-flat, Majesty.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Yes, sir.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Papa, is this your idea?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Is he working?
What did he say? What did he say?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What for?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
With all my heart, Mozart.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
How long will you give me?
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
What?
Shall I answer it?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
It couldn't be simpler.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Do you have it?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Exactly. A dance.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Yes.
He's setting that play to music?
Are you absolutely sure?
Ballet? What ballet?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
Herr Salieri.
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Dr. Hirsch?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Now what do you want to talk about?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
What?
Are you better now?
My friend Jack was just here.
The kitchen.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
David, what are you doing?
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Now see here young man.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
You've never had bad dreams before?
Jack.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Okay.
What about it?
Ask them what the candles are for.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Shit! David, what is that?
What's the plan?
Where are we going?
You really scared me, you shithead.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm not listening!
It's you, David.
What are you doing here?
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
What can I say, Jack?
You were saying?
What can we do to assist you?
Sorry, love.
Do you have any hot soup?
Oh.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
He has?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Charlie!
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
And tell him not to delay.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that—
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
That don't do us any good.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Me?
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Doesn't that come next?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
No.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
Why, Matt!
Let me see your cash book, will you?
I'm not interested in what you think.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Shall we let the people come in?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Got my letter?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
No. I won't.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
I'm afraid so.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh, Matt . . .
They must have turned him down.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
Then who changed it?
So you were home last night?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
You can ride like that?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
How many of them did he kill?
But if we take their money and supplies...
Beg pardon?
He's planning a job.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
You shut up now, boy.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Not now.
Thanks for the help.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
What are you saying?
Still smells fishy.
Missed you, cousin.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Cannon or Gatling?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Jesse.
Of St. Louis?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Web died fighting?
You know you're welcome any time!
They're gone. What are you --
You are a charmer.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Uncle Frank?
But still died.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Yep.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Why, yeah.
Really?
Not at all.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
How can that be?
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
With my money!
Parker.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
This is no game.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
So he's won.
What the hell is that sound?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
I know. Stop it.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
J&B. Straight.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
I haven't seen you around here.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
We should do it.
He has a great body
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
We need to talk.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Listen, what about dinner?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
I think you should go now.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
You don't like this, I take it?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
So, what do you do?
A model? An actor?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Don't tell him you're here.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Where did you go to school?
Yeah...Yale thing.
He had a yacht?
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Have you consulted a psychic?
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Well, I could he wrong.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Speak up. Come on.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
You are a fanatic.
That took some fun out of --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
You look beautiful.
Milo?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
And Outpost? You're happy there?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Is it your software?
What?!
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
'Think I should buy some originals?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
What?
Gary?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Come with me.
You know mine.
Did I say something?
Did you wanna be alone?
I snuck into #21.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
How close are you?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Please don't go.
Bring it to the other location.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Maybe he'll get back to work.
That kid's the great white hope.
You seem surprised to see me.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you.
Yes?
Where am I?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Be careful.
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
Carnies.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
That does not compute.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Fancy a nibble?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Really, Austin!
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Does that make you horny?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Quite impressive.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
What is it now?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Umm, that also has already happened.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... death ...
Nature ...
How long have I been here?
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
What are you trying to do to me?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I didn't. Mother did.
Do you?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
But
Is that what you think?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I could save you the trouble.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
I'll be back ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Steed
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Weather's turning nasty.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
This man -- did you see him?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
John Steed.
One shot -- for emergencies.
You said ... one shot.
What's happening?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Cole...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
No, Cole, I...
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
That feels so great.
Let go of me!
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Let's go.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
It's true.
What can I be doing for you?
You want to share it?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Really?
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
What's the matter?
I'm not really hungry.
How 'bout this?
Hey, you guys...
Reach out and snort someone.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Wash it to the windows?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Is he...
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
I like what you've done with the place.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Hi.
You think that's really any of your business?
What is --
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Oh Jesus Christ...
I want another shot, Sir.
I need another one, sir.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Read.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Then who wrote the report?
Just wondering.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
I have a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Who's going to die?
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
It knows us. This one knows us.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
You don't have the demographics.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
What do you do?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
Please, have a seat.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
But the line has to be drawn.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Just want to say good luck.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
This is crazy.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
So they can be on TV.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No joke.  Serious.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
Mommy, please don't call me that.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
How did you get this gig?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Yes you!
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...yes she did.
Around...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I fell out of my bed last night.
I slept too near where I fell out.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Oh you do, huh?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Maybe you need to start.
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Don't try to change to the subject.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Who else can give me information about you?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
No.
Not one.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
You want my heart?
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I feel the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
All the same, you must name an amount.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Does this assignment interest you?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Yes, he's fine.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
What about Pike?
You framed-him...
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
There's no need...
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
And he'd been shot.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Cadet, what's your name!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
So you killed him?
Roberto, what the fuck?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
How do you know?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
What I said before --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
You're kidding.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No.
What if I don't want it?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We should tell him we're not going.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
Who, Levi --
Thank God...
So?
You think he did it?
What happens to Dunbar now?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
In so many words, yes.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Okay.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
You know where the chemicals are?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
I'm sorry.
Daffodils?
I was drying out.
Wait! I need those!
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mmm.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
That really happened?
Is he awake?
Mom?
You know what for.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
That's not a burn.
Say thank you.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Hello.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
No.
When?
Binoculars.
How is bank?
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants the money from your bank.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
They go.
In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
And? What are you saying?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes which?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I got what I paid for.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What?
I don't know.
No. What? No. I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
What do you need?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Holy shit.
What happened?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Better?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
I deserve better than this.
Better than what you give.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Let me say somethin' first...
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Want another?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Could you do somethin' for me?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Goin' dove huntin'?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
Then what?
Heard about this morning.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
This ain't gonna work.
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
You got any money?
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Back-up.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
What are they doing now?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Getting very weird.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Squid?
Joyce can be nice.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
What'd I tell you?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
She disappeared... shit!
Nick --
What's in the box?
Joyce?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Ich said you left.
She ever pull down her shades?
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
I don't remember saying yes.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
One guy do all the damage?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
With these?
One man.  He must be good.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Industrial refuse.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Okay, but...
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Next.
Number three.
Prosit.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Who?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What shows?
What the fuck for?
It that mother real?
Jeezus!
Are you apprehensive?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
How come you're not on the job?
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
May I ask a personal question?
But in your profession that is a risk.
She didn't know?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What about friends?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Your mom was a dancer?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I came on a bus.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
...Okay.
Who are these people?
Wait! Wait!
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
I guess we'll need another locker.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Then forget it.
This is for me.
Bites what?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Get out!
Yes!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Where's he gone?
All right.
Hey, Eve!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Eve?!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
What?
A card?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
These are wonderful.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Uh-huh.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Right on the button.
What's the capitol?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
The recovery is very impressive.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
You bet!
What?
Does that work?
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
How old are you?
You don't look thirty-five.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Well, where are you --
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Days??
The locks?
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
I've noticed.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Hi, honey!
What did you wish for, Adam?
Should we say a little prayer first?
We stay down here.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I want him to at least see the sky!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
What's that mean?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
What?
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Are you Detective Williams?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you like me?
No.
No. What is happening?
Nice guy. Who's he?
Who is Don?
What do you want to do?
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. No!
Hold me, Don.
MOMMY!
Who's this fuck?
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
No thanks.
Heineken.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Nothing. I'm fine.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Are you feeling okay?
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So, what's next?
Yes. I do.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Okay, yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
You like mysteries that much?
Everything okay?
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
NO.
You want to dance?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Look Jeffrey.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Just for him?
Up where?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You think they sold me out? No way.
Anybody see ya?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
We're alive.
What are you going to do?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Absolutely not.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nervous?
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Who did you kill?
Give the guy a shot.
He isn't to be touched.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
So, what do we do now?
They were wearing masks.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Promise me boys.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Roc. You okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
Yes.
Has he now?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
He's a nigger.
What color hair does he have?
This is he?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
How was I ridiculing you?
It had an alarm.
Is it back in?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Where's the manager?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Well, then cut it in half.
I'll just say it.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
He went back for his brother.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
She doesn't need to know.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
Dignan. Take it easy.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
We all set?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Who tripped the alarm?
What are you doing?
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
No. I'm not.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
You mean a safecracker?
Did Dignan take the test?
Are you afraid?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Absolutely.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Give him a second.
It's in the driveway.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
That's Anthony.
Wait. Did he see us?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
No.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's my responsibility.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
You really think he'll remember you?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
You can go first, Bob.
The weed.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
How long has he been in there?
Bob, that makes no sense.
This could be a trap.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I'm sorry, Bob.
Come on, Bob.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Why?
What?
No. Just pool.
How's the weather down there?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And what are we looking for?
May I finish?
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Sorry to wake you.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit down.
Sir...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Who else knows about this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
What do you want?
Try again.
Who sent you to Greece?
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
That's crazy.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- where's left to go? --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I know it's a dream.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
Abbott?
What do you want?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
-- go -- take the van! --
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
This is everything? Is there.
Still...
So he fooled you.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Do we know what this says?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
Yes. In that order.
Someone dead from this household?
But... what will you do?
Peace?!
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He won't come.
Wallace has sacked York!
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
You'll move
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
Then when?
I need you so much! I love you!
Peace is made is such ways.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Who would do such a thing?
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
We're gonna be late again.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
All the dads are gonna be there.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
I... I blacked out.
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
There must be a way to fix this.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Oh? There's proof now?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
What time is it?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
And you are...?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
What the hell are you doing?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Lung cancer?
Just get out, didja?
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Shut up, Tommy!
Monsieur Rick?
I should have known.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
How long have you been married?
So you decided to go to America.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Here you are.
Here's to you, sir.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Do you know where they are?
Rick?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, of course, we --
I didn't count the days.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Goodnight.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
What happened with Rick?
Did he give any reason?
Yes, Victor, I was.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
And I congratulate you.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I beg your pardon?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
This is hardly the time or the place.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Even in Berlin.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Is that a serious offer?
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, no, Rick never --
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
I have. Sit down over there.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
I would advise you not to interfere.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
No more water, you said.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
What's so damn funny?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
No.  that was the last one.
Chuck.
Merry Christmas eve.
He is a cute thing.
You know, for when you travel.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
Get back?  From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
Anything else?
Which I didn't have.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Thought you were going to bring her.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
The place is falling apart.
Trying.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I didn't know we had sailboats.
And never take.
That's why you're a gambling man.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
You're fucking dead!
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
What, then?
May I ask, where are you bound?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I've never seen a lobster.
Oh...
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Hi...
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
There! You said it was boring.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
I just wanted to ask you...
*Liver* killed him?
What's a nanny do?
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Did you bite it?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
At what altitude?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
They're migrants.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
What's that? What's it called?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I thought it was my turn.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I am not a doctor.
What's that?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
You're not yet three months, are you?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Then it's malaria?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Don't this place look like home?
So, what do you do?
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
What's this?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
The Anti-Christ?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Like what?
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Ten is standard, sir.
Who's that?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Jake...
It can buy you a new and better you.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Minus one.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Listen, Scooter --
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Come on. Harder.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
No.  What's my cut?
Mr. King, I think --
You need to get a haircut.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you deal with --
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You tell them the "Tale".
Tick-tock...
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Meet me at my place later.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
We're getting a little old for running.
Him.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
King ain't gonna like this.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Aces, Suits.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
So what do you want?
Still time.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Who?
Peace of mind.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I'll take you up on that.
I got scared.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
She went back to South Africa.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Good night?
I couldn't resist them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
It came my way. 450 a week.
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Oh hello.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
What happened?
Which side do you like?
I didn't.
I know that. But you can now.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
But if it does.
Is it yes?
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Detective Inspector Ross.
I'm Lucy.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
What are you, a cop?
Who are these guys?
And the girls?
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Rough day?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
You want me to check?
Ever?
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Yeah.
What's he doin'?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Thanks.
You are false data.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb...
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
This is fun.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Pinback...
What are you gonna name it?
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- automatic channels open --
Must get lonely being up here so much.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
You know what I think about, Talby?
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander? Are you still there?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
How're ya doin', Max.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Why would I be pissed?
What are you doing here?
What is it?
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
I know.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
No...
You're a thief?
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Bent.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
What's in it for you?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Who are you?
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Thank you.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
That's odd...
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Please...
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Make the call.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Right, the big one-oh.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
And why should she?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
Thanks, miss.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
We've got to take this slow...
Ann Arbor?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
What are you, high?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Whoa... she just farted.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
What the fuck!
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Jam, listen up.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
They're not idiots.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
It's gone.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Good morning, mongrels!
Are you AFRAID?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
I'm not following you.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Dea ex machina...
Who is... we?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
How old is Grandma Death?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Wanna walk me home?
So... you just moved here?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
That was a compliment.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
We're moving through time.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
What?
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
What is her name?
What else do you think about during school?
Can anyone else see him?
How does that make you feel?
Is Callie still around?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Gerald.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Mrs. Leeman?
Oh shit!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Hi...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Are we on "Cops" again?
This here's Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
You don't know where this is gonna...
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
Have you got a license?
What kind of a dog is he?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
Then it's war?
Was it -- swine?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Your Excellency!
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Yes.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I want my man back.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
You've acquired a taste for this?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Treves. Well done.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Are you comfortable here?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
How awful for John.
Is he... dying then?
My... name is...
Mmmerrick.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
The hospital?
Good morning, John.
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Pardon me?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
I've never LOVED anybody!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
You're as bad as my father.
Erik. You don't understand.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Do you believe I love you?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
What do you see, Erik?
Is it night or day, Erik?
Have you done this sort of thing before?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
Why should you care?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Let's hack her to pieces.
What's wrong with making friends?
What?
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
SHUT UP!
What did he say?
You must help us.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
A magic dishcloth.
No! Let go, Snorri!
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
What are you talking about, Erik?
Look, I bagged it last week.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
It can't do you any HARM...
How did he do that?
Aaagh!
Well! Come on!
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I must KILL! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
There is nothing we can do...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
And keep your sword greased.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
May I help you?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Really? Because --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I can't remember.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Yeah.
Take care.
Um --
You like that?
Ready for another?
Thanks.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yo ho ho!
So, um --
Such a beautiful view.
There's this guy!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Joel!
Happy Birthday.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Probably.
Hi there.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think, before.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I knew.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I think I should go back.
Have sex. Y'know --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
How's it going?
That's me.
It was snowing.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
So then she just stops calling.
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Yours?
So what's going on, Joel?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
It's just... y'know... I mean...
See you later, alligator.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Hey.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
What, Howard?
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Stan? What's going on?
Well, where was Patrick?
Mary. What are you doing here?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Does that help?
Yeah?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Is everything getting worse?
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
You're political, then?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Whose fault was that?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
I'm cold.
What are you doing?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Why? Why do you have to go?
So now you're bummin' around?
Hitchhiking?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Holy shit...
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
Please...
90 over 50 and falling... .
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
...I don't want to die...!
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
What's the hold up?
We've got pressure.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Yes.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
We're leaving.
You... You can't do that!
Your eyes...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Sir.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
You've got to listen...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He served on the Goliath.
Claire...
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
We have to do something, oh God...
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
A straight line.
What is it?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
What are you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
Where is Reed?
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
Isn't that your speech?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
What the --!
We had a tough year.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Where... where am I?
What's wrong with me?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
You're hot!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
What are you doing --
Front page?
Feeling better?
Which was?
What?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Easy, mon.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Hi, Brad.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I'm just guessing.
You are a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
Any problems?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
You're a really good kisser.
Oh. Hi.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Hey, Rat.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Yo.
You're losing it, Damone.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
My brother's car!
My brother is gonna shit.
That's him! He did it!
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Well I never did it.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
How long does Doug take?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Not coming? What happened?
Sometime?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Mr... Mr. Hand.
What's that?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Thanks for picking me up.
How about the point?
Is this your first time?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Where's your brother?
What's April 16th?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Let's have lunch!
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Killed?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Naw!
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Why?
Jesus creeping shit!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
That's what gives me The Fear.
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Can we make it?
I want to leave fast.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Where'd you get that knife?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
What tape?
Jesus.
You degenerate pig!
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
Adrenochrome...
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
The airport is over there!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
Where are you two going?
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Stop it.
Wha?
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What tunnel? Where?
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
We just smeared a skunk.
You seem mighty collected about this.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Ohhh.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
We gotta be close.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
It's much safer in there, sweety.
What? Really?
He's dead.
Huh?
What's going on between you two?
Nine?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Welcome back.
Got 'cha!
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?!
DON'T!
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Let's go!
Get to your cars!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Her name is Charlie.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Well... come on.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Frances?  Oh no.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
You're afraid!
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
What's up?
You don't think I'm good enough?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Harry!
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
Of course.
...So what do you think?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
But, Kurt, I...
Age?
Just one minute...
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Oh no...
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Is that why you did it?
You're telling me.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
What for?
I'll bet.
I should've known...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What?
I'm not!
But I want to. I'm trying!
Mama...
But they're using you!
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Yes...?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Is there something else?
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
And he drove me to mine.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
You dance so beautifully together.
I should go. I should leave today.
He always was opinionated.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
This feels... incestuous.
You make me weak.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
I thought I'd never see you again!
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
No. But someday.
I am not mad.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Next Friday.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
You can only do what you can do.
Where?
Jack?
What's the matter with it?
I'm sorry.
You know what I said, though.
Claudette...
Let's go back, Barry...
Give me a hand?
Thanks.
What is it?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
How about our last jay?
I love you.
Looks like a storm.
Best over...
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
I mean...
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
What's this guy's problem?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Was? As in not anymore?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Then?
Who else?
Why are you so agitated?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
What?
Do what?
Do you believe me?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
I'm really sorry.
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Were you giving that pig signals?
Whiskey!
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
Do they have cable?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
You okay?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
I'm here with you.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How are you?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Of course, but there's more --
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Really, I have no problem with --
Oh, really.
No, sir, WHAT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Fine by me, sir!
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Should probably ask him that.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Come on, Montgomery...
Time.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
So why are you telling me this?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Which is guy-speak for...
They're more afraid of you.
Who is it?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
O'Neil?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
32 feet, six inches!
'Cool?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
What?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
And you think this creature is one of them?
...he's pregnant.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Merde!
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
It's the French Secret Service.
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
And note the sucked in gut.
We heard it the first time!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
I don't know.
Hi Brandon.
Yes but, we were wondering-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Yes...?
No, wait, are you-
What?  Up?
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
... What does that mean?
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
A hologram...
No, I'll kill you. .
How do you remember this stuff?
THAT'S why you built this ship?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Are they behind us?
Can it be repaired?
You're playing your good side.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Explain -
We pretend...
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Theramin.
But what if Sarris survives?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
A model, only as big as this.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Oh, right, sorry.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Is that a fact.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
I hope I never have to believe that.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
What?  What are you talking about?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Well, what have you thought?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What is this?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
Oh, come now...
You think that?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Unofficially, General Greene.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
That's right...
Martha... what?
Not today.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
A horseshoer?
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
What are you doing?
You're out of your mind!
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
About sixty.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
You gave him the money?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
She's... young.
You know how to write one of these?
I need the money.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I'm working on a few things.
The airport.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
You say look at you?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Sovereign.
Who the fuck are you?
You're an investor, is that it?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
That's what I'm doing.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You make movies, huh?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
It was in the Herald.
Yeah. That was a good party.
We talk different?
I'm thinking of a movie.
How about this?
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Whatta you think, Chill?
You've been losing.
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
The door from the patio, in back.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Rough day on the set?
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I got you a copy of the script.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
I don't know.
You okay?
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Harry -–
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
But you are interested?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Damn mind of it's own.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
The turbine blew.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
Get up.
But how long?
Goddamit, Dodge.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Or somebody stopped them.
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Bodies're too fresh.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Yeah.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Don't fall asleep.
What?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
What'd you find up there?
She was sailing up north, right?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
What guy?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
He needs a doctor.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
It's not gonna hold us.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
What do you think?
What happened?
You killed them.
Greer to Murphy.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
It's funny.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Morning.
Ho-ly shit.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
I thought you say Tuesday.
You're kidding, right?
Give up?
Maxine.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Did you actually do this painting?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Hmm.
...wow...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
That guy rules!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Yeah, right...
Nothing.
When did I say I hated you?
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
You call.
You're better at it.
I want to "make love" to him.
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
Ew, look at this...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
That was truly pathetic.
Not really...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
Where are we going?
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Ew ... when did you get that?
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Look, we have to get these...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Hello?
There.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
May I ask what you're doing?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Really? Can I see it?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
What about her? Would you go out with her?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I don't think so...
So, why did you bring this along?
For nineteen years...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
You can open your eyes now.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
No, of course not.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
What about Joe?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
Yeah, well... me neither...
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
I agree.
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
No... they said she was here...
What do you mean?
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
And it worked?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Anything special about them?
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
How lucky we are.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
I'll be bait alone?
The workers don't get on?
Nonsense.
Soon. 
You like him, don't you?
You've known him long?
He has children?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
His name is Oscar.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does she know anything about babies?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
You've got to do something!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Who?
Who, Ray?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
What's your story, Pete?
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
She's moving!
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
That's too bad.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You're the best one in your row.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
He is the Destructor.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
All right.  What is it?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Something was definitely here.
Don't cross the beams.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Set entry grid.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
How do you know?
Who was the architect?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Where is my family?
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
So am I.
Give away food?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Death is a very light thing for you.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Then get a large cash advance.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Why not?
I want to go home.
But could you try?
We won't. Let's go inside.
With a family?
Did they ever find out?
Okay.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Yes.
What?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Is it because I'm here?
Well, I want you to leave.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
What are you going to do now?
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
You really will?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
The day after tomorrow?
Ben!
Yes, I will.
What's that?
You're not one of those agitators?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
I'm putting it on the top step.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
Is it a girl?
You don't?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What do you think?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Won't you unzip my dress?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But they would! Don't you see?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Do you understand what I said?
Yes, I do.
May I sit down?
He didn't see me.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Well.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
You're not interested in art?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
What kind of car was it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
No.
I wish you'd tell me.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Good.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Well, I'm not.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Nothing else.
They don't know?
Well --
I don't know. I want it to be --
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
HUH?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Turn 'em up.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
How?
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Like dancing?
He must be very nice.
You?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Too bad.
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Go away. Who are you --?
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
No?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Grusinskaya --
Why later?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Bless you...
I can't.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Till then.
The Baron is tired?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
If we could scare up some men to play.
That was my last.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
The war.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
For me?
Oh -- but -- I --
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Please -- please!
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you like me better?
Moreover --
Moreover...
What is this?
Cotton Company --
How nice -- your daughters?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must go to England -- at once.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
How clear is Manchester?
You see -- what we are interested in --
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Madam should sleep.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Four minutes past. Please come.
No. No word.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Pretty as a picture.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
You're calling the shots.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Whadaya say?
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
I just came back from Phoenix.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
You want a drink?
For God's sake, Lilly!
You're getting off the grift?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Big spender.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
I've heard the name.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Yeah?
Running your broker scam, you mean.
What is it? What's going on?
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Sure. Let's get it over.
That's that, then.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Why am I here?
Well, when you put it that way.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
You take all your dates here. Blake?
I can be real stiff.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
What the --
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Now you're joking, right?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
I'm not leaving without her.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then I'll get caught.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Hey, you alright?
What are you looking at?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Keri, you all right?
You aced it, didn't you?
Fuckin' A.
You're so easy...
Thanks!
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Whatever happened to women in back?
What if your parents come home?
Mommy!!!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Halloween.
Where are you going?
Danny?!  Danny!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Home is important to a man.
Um.
I suppose.
I didn't tell you everything.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
What'll you do for transportation?
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
You ever own a motorcycle?
Go to the funeral?
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
We got to get another pilot.
For Africa.
What went wrong?
Gee whiz--
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
Anybody home?
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Excellent!
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Dad--
What kind of exercise?
I'm a man.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Eighteen--  and a half.
Disease?
Bluh.
Your old beau?
Harold!
Now that's what I call fun.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
You used to like it stark!
Now--turn around, if you would.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have some change!
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I came for my clothes.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
A dozen?
He cried.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Honor, I suppose.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm going to call the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I mean it!
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
I'm an honorable clown?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
No.
You didn't even find that out?
What happened?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Kid--kid--
I know.
Thank you, kind sir.
I don't really know.
Where will you be?
Yes, he is.
Is Norbert still here?
What's his name?
What?
What does he say to do?
My father!
It's fine!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't?
Possibly.
I'm sorry.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
They didn't murder me.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
No. I don't think so.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
What?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Are you the star of this picture?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
You making a feature?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Up front?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You don't drink?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
Neither am I.
They were here?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I can stop if you want.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
More or less.
They are the same.
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
You are.
Hello?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
They're legal now.
I don't know.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
But this is my apartment.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What is it, Jake?
What happened?
Is Marsha there?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where's Ratan?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
What's that?
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
The guy who bought you that ring.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Yes.
Could I see your registration?
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
What do you want?
Sorry I'm late.
Eh, no.
But this is my car.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Sort of.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
It goes on and on.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
You don't look eighty.
That's a nice teapot.
Why do you say that?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Why not?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Okay?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Oh.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
How about some candy floss?
- end where I began.
It looks like you. Thanks.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Mother.
Mother.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Would you like a cigarette?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
What would you say?
Yes.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Harold, calm down! This is...
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
I want to go back!
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
What do you mean?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I've got to finish it.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
They were over here, Professor.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
That's all for you, Sammy.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
Strong.
But it's not true, is it?
Christ!
You fucking ass-holes.
It's my lucky day.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Oh.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
Come to Daddy.
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
Don't look at me.
Well?
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
You would be. They tore me apart.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
Not exactly modern.
You're still blaming me.
Well?
How are you doing through there?
Julia?
Who was it?
-- I'll go see.
Oh baby.
What's wrong with you?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
You'd like the house.
Great.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Of course. Every day.
Kirsty.
What are you drinking, love?
Yeah.
No you don't.
Get the fuck out of here.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
What do we do if there isn't?
I see.
I've been better.
Can I lend you a hand?
Don't you want to hear what's next?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
The little skate-fuckers.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
Like fuck you are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Great.  Can I have it then?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Hey, Barry.
Oh.  Okay.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Is there a difference?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
'Morning, Dick.
Good weekend?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Can I do anything?
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
What were the others?
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Of course it is.
Hi.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
Hello.
Don't forget your CDs.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I guess I am.
Hello.
Are you alright?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
I'm sorry.
Look, are you coming or not?
What do you want to do?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
You know, with Ray...
Laura...
Mission accomplished.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Nothing.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
Very persuasive.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Is Ray going?
So you live in Chicago now?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
So so.  Up and down.
She left.  She's gone.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
And after that?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
You're the expert.
You're very macabre.
Would you like more tea?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
You have an active imagination.
He tried to kill me last night.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
No.
You're wrong.
You did kill those men.
You make it all sound so simple.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
You're using your son's name.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Don't.
What is it like?  Being you?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Who is it?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Does it change with me in the room?
He told me there could be only one.
I don't understand.
I'm twenty-two.
It is the truth.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Oh please.  Another one.
Something pretty.
Who am I deceiving?
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Complete your inspection?
Your name?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Do not turn your back on me.
Where!
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point?
We have some unfinished business.
Did you know the victim?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
What doing?
How do you mean?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Oh, it isn't like that.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
The five hundred? Sure.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Oh, she was here.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Ts! Ts! Ts!
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Hello, Hildy!
How long is what?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
I haven't any hard feelings.
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What do you mean?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Exclusive? That's great.
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
She jumped out of the window.
Where do you think you're going?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Don't open that!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Flip a coin.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Who do you want?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
I don't know --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Open up there, will you!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Hold the phone!
Goodbye, Yonson.
We know what you're up to.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Where'd you get this?
He's harmless.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Where's the old lady?
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Where's the money?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
What's the idea?
Hey --
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who? Me?
Get the cops, somebody.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
The door was locked.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
It's true.
I never was.
Do you know any swear words?
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
You're the biggest fibber.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
You said that last year, Dad.
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Where?
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
Why not?
How's your war, Mac?
No Turks.
We don't know anything about it
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
What are you going to be then?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
You know it? It must be an old one.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
Is it peace in out time?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
He could always make me laugh.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Cone.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
Tiny's home.
Drink up, it's party time.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Which way?
How much further?
Is your brother ready to go?
He left!
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
I'd like to see that.
What the hell are you laughing about?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Really fucking awesome.
She looks like she stinks.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Almost there.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Hey, he moved.
Fine. I'll go straight.
What are you doing!
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Fuck your grandmother.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So.
What are you laughing at?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Rise and shine.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
God damn.
Open up the trunk.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Turn up this road.
What about the body you found?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Tell him, Harold.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Like what?
Please. I look a mess.
Hunh.
You were wonderful!
Lila?
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
He's dead.
Progress!
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
So?
Yeah?
How'd you know where I was?
Done!
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Who is it?
Who from work?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Bravo to you, Puff!
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Oh boy!
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
No, why?
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
Pittsburgh?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Are you ready for another?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
We'll be there.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Seventy-five per cent.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Hello, Eddie.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Here, I got it.
Hey, Findley's here.
Well, we won't.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Tell her what?
Half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Yeah, that's right.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Whaddya mean?
You don't need a drink.
Go to hell.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Just like that?
Findley.
I thought we came here to play pool.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Who's he?
Gimme ten bucks.
Okay, friend. You're on.
How long you been waiting?
How long have you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
What time does the bus leave?
Have a nice trip?
Can I sit down?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Yeah? What do you do now?
Hey!
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Oh, cut my finger.
Do you want me to go?
You going out?
What are you writing?
Who is it?
He's a gambler.
What do you want to tell me?
A week? A year?
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Hundred dollars?
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Are you all right?
Do you remember where it is?
Why don't you start with me?
I only protect myself -- !
Emma...
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
It was so real, Dad.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
No.
They'll get us.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
You're looking for life?
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What do you want?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Spunky. He told you about that?
Love was never our problem.
You saved a lot of lives.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
A countdown to what?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Not listed, huh?
You try Martin?
This I can see.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
This is ridiculous.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
So, what do you do for a living?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
I'm not leaving.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Yes.
May we go home now, please?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
What about you?
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Where did this come from?
You could be more right than you know.
DONOVAN!
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
The Ark of the Covenant.
My room!
Knock it off. You're not mad.
What are you going to do?
How did you get here?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Through the library?
If only I could have been with you.
You did!!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
The floor's on fire! See?!
And the chair.
Dad!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Ready?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Who are you?
And why were you trying to kill me?
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
You understand what he tells us?
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
That's far enough!
I like the service here.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
You all right?
What'd he say?
What do you mean -- how?
Indy! Help me!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
What's happening?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Not leftovers?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
What is it...?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
I want to go home...
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Arrrgh!
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
I know...it sounds insane.
You're not crazy.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
I'll tell you what to say.
What'd he look like?
Now what?
Thanks.
A lab and equipment.
That's not a good idea.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
You mean...just leave.
...and a license to kill...
Do you notice anything.
Swim.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
She doesn't seem to understand.
What?
Wait.
It worked.
Now, where would I be?
You really like that shirt?
Not that tie with that coat.
Get close to them.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
I feel like an idiot.
Joe, be careful!
What is it?
You been had. We have.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
...drink it.
I can't...
Door to the right. Get up and run.
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
Left...The one with the red dot.
Be quiet.
Never mind that, where are we now.
Gimme a minute.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
You just got a Mickey.
Sorry...
Doesn't matter.
I'm against it.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Surveillance Cameras?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Yes?
I don't want to intrude.
You may not remember things.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you do...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Fine. You look fine.
Take the card.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Al?
Now you know what I know.
The fresh tuna?..
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
The poet...something he said...
What's so funny?
What way?
You again.
As if your mind's not all there.
Promise you what?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Trans Ocean Travel.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why?
Were you working for him last night?
Who did?
This business is over.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
You don't believe me.
Then why are you smiling like that?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Now what?
Where what?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What a mess.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
How?
Now what?
He can't help us.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Excuse me?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Wait.
It's alright.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
When's your deadline?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
What does that do?
Sure.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
That computer has everything...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Come again?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Use the bathroom.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
It would be better if he called us.
We're there.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Yeah.
I disappeared on you?
Yeah, that's right.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Look, I really don't have that much time...
How much would I get paid?
Should I just take the documents now?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Hello. You there
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Lowell, I can't afford --
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
I told the truth!
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
What about now?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Object to the form!
Object!
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Why in God's name would I want...?
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Getting married.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Yes? Marylin?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No.
I don't have a ring!
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Comfy!
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
Hello?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
Hello, Rex.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I was devastated. Of course.
Forgery and Fraud?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Do you know him?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Every week --
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Is this Ming?
What?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Ha Ha.
...arty farty!
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
And it's good!
Mr. Rexroth.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
In anticipation of making you sick.
And she has...?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She owes me a meal.
Wrigley?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Extinguish?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Three is not Farrow.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
We'll go into that some other time.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What's this about not eating?
I might.
You ought to know why. Because—
Where are you taking me?
South America!
Ellie—
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Who is he?
Oh, come now—
Why should she? After all—
It's my daughter! Go after her.
You talk as if—
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
We've done that already.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
What happened?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
I don't want it reported!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
This isn't "piggy-back."
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
This looks like the best spot.
Really?
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Eat a carrot.
What happened?
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
—six—seven—eight—nine—
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
But can't you wait until morning—
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Up yonder. See the lights?
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Get out of here!
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What's the thousand bucks for?
If it's on the level.
I'd put you there myself.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Not a minute!
Yeah.
What's the idea?
I can use a smart guy like you.
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Right.
Street cats?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Who?
What do you think, Lou?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Did he pay you for this?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Can you get some sworn statements?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
You know damn well who it is.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
What do you mean?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
That's our case!
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Hi.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
For sexual purposes?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Oh no!... How bad?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Post Office.
Can we find her?
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
You know who the mayor was?
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
This looks pretty good on me.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I understand.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What'd ya mean?
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Does he have the marked bills on him?
You got a good lawyer?
She knows it's my case?
We are. Don't worry about it.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'm not a loser.
What's this?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
You don't want much, do you?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
I don't think so.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
No, you didn't. What branch?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
What, I couldn't hear you?
Who is this?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He told me last night.
How do you feel about getting old?
Catching a movie.
Who was your girl before Annette?
How old's Annette?
Will Ordell go for that?
I see.
You're avoiding the question.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Did you do it that night?
The feds. It's evidence.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
In a dress.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I didn't use you, Max.
We're partners.
What if I plead guilty?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
We can look into that.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
Not yet.
You said that the last time.
Ever been tempted?
Yes. All those things are true.
That would be one point of view.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about you?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
You already knew that?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
For what?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
How the fuck they know that?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Didja tell 'em anything else?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
No, I give it to someone else first.
Plus the same deal as before.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
What does she think she's gettin?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
I lived there for about nine months.
About five years ago.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
We're leaving now!
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Who was Beaumont?
How much is there?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Uh-huh.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
Came outta where?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
How can I help you?
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
House or apartment?
Comfortable?
You didn't hear?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Where is it?
You still there?
How'd you find me?
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
It's the next street.
Turn left.
He's around.
Get me out of here.
Hello.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Daddy, what was that noise?
Wait ... Daddy.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
What do you mean, demons?
I saw Sarah the other day.
A bit.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She hates me, Louis.
I had this weird flash just then.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where'd you leave 'em?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
What?
Wait. Don't.
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
What the hell are you doin'?
What'd the doctor say?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who else were you expecting?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Who was that?
I can waitress. I'm good.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
This isn't happening.
WHO ARE YOU?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
You got a nice tan, though.
I'll page him.
Lennox Hospital.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
The army?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
A car accident.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Duck fuckers?
Goodbye old friend.
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Minimal.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Bomb?
Sergeant!
Where the hell were you?!!
Better let me.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Done!
Where is...?
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
Earth II.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Wait a minute...I need...
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
We're screwed!
Rizzo?!
Hey.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Rizzo, you okay?
Well?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
Kaboom.
Okay?!!
I'll help you in.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
I...I don't know what I did...
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
I don't know...sorry?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Kay-em you okay?
I don't understand...what does he want?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
How do you open the damn door?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
What have you done?
Can we get through these?
My cars. And a comic book.
You got it?
That's it! Radio in for help!
What about us?
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Who's that young man?
She's right.
He lost it on the way up.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
What? What?!
What is all this stuff?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
You all right?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
Think she might've run out on you?
You here for the summer?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Look at him take it!
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Coming right to us!
What can that gun of yours do?
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Hey Bleek.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Charisma?
What's up?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Wait, let me take that.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
What, you mean as friends?
Mine too.
Can we make out now?
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What a trip, man.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
When was this, like '96?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Cute?
But I thought you'd be cool if...
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Is the baby okay?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Yeah, she does.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Is this Juno?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Aha! You love him.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
No way! She's pretty.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
You don't say.
So. What's that thing?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
What did you do?
What?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Hi, I'm Adele.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Adele... are you serious?
Carryin' a gun.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Happy birthday Adele.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Yeah but, what is it?
...thank you.
Henry Lucas.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
You two been busy in here.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Who said he's my good buddy?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
What about you?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
How old you?
You're clean.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Where you goin' tonight?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. Come on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Uh huh.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Because your a virgin?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Come dance.
Telly is at Steven's?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Yeah.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Oh shit.
I hate 'em.
Yeah?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Not too late.
Hello?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Yeah.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Casual.
What do you mean, no?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
No.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Then let's narrow it down.
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
The message!  I figured out--
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
You still having a problem with this?
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
What is it?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
What do you mean, stand out?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Why her?
Just like who?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Hello.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Let me speak to my daughter.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Nope.  Nothing.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
Come here.
Is your dad here?
Do you like my dad?
What is it, dad?
You ready?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Any sign of rape?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Anything?
You mean, no prints but hers?
How long she been dead?
Well?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
What time did he get there?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
Bainbridge Books.
Are you with the tournament?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Do you?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
You have to win every point, don't you?
Of course.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
She died in a car accident.
What?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Hi.
It's over now.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Me too.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
They have Lyssa!
There is no other way.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
I cannot reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
But you suspect.
Never.
From here, I must go alone.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
I road them often in my youth.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not worth returning to?
Even by you?
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
And where do you lead, boy?
I'm not hungry.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
My heart stays here.
Sugarballs?
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
And do you think I live on air?
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Yes.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Kegan!
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
She was not as beautiful.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Wow! It's brilliant!
The fat man down there, on the bench.
May I go to the cinema?
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Where are you going?
It's too big.
Poor darling, and then?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Yes?
...Yes?
How are you, Miss?
...Composer.
But... He works for your same employer?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
This smells good.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
What would you like us to do?
How long does this... Mania last?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Yes?
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Anything?
Walk with me?
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
What did they ask?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
To where?
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Perhaps there's another route?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
When are you leaving?
You're walking to California?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
I missed you Kris.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Are they standing?
Come on Mr. Parker.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
There are a lot of people worried about you.
In a hospital.
What do your friends call you?
You're in pain.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
What's your shoe size?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
Are you working?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Don't run away.
What's up?
You OK?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Hi!
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Will you lighten up, please?
What did they look like?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Yes? What?
What alibi?
Why would I kill my husband?
I'll take that as a no.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
It's so shameful...
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
No.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Did you hear a shot fired?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Where you got in the shower.
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Did you get it?
Why the hell not?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Was she carrying a weapon?
I'm sorry?
Uh -- both?
Yes?
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Our group is full.
The idiot speaks.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
You're pawning The Rock?!
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
She's not!
Someone missed you.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Amazing how?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I completely agree.
That's not entirely --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
Pink ones.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Fool's magic.
We come watch... we come watch...
We go out, smash 'em now?
Birdies... pretty...
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Yes?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
Enough!
You be our guest, Jack.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
But... but, why?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Shhhh!
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Aye!  That too.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
God's blessing.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Will you explain what's going on?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
I was with the Princess.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
We seek to undo the curse.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
You promised!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
What shall we do?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Jack!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Pinching?  Where?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
No!
This is not the time for squabbling.
I'd be honored.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
The fastest in the world.
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Hello, Jack.
How came you by this blade?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Marco!
Dad's disappeared!
What's that for?
He hasn't called?
Mom?
I put him to work.
Are you his friend?
I'm living here while I build another house.
What's today?
My keys.
Can you keep Sam straight?
You're a good girl.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
He's a freak.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
I was wondering.
Not really.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
This is such a street of whiners.
Are you guys' friends?
I have the permit.
I'm good, thanks.
Right...she married...what was he?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Is Alyssa home?
Sam?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
You're here early today.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
I did warn you.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Because I live there.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Probably in the bible.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I don't know.
I don't beg.
I'm leaving.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Where is it?
Did you got through my pants?
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I took some of your Vicodin.
What would you like to be?
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
I loved him too much.
You look better than ever.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
And you told Mom today?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
What would you do?
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Because Dad left?
You should lock your doors.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
Lock the door behind you.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
A blueprint spool.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
When's school over?
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
George --
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
What is it?
Finished or unfinished?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
You brought your kids?
Do you need help?
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I thought we were helping.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
Is your back still killing you?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
I wasn't sure.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck?
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
After the kids are back in school.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
That's the problem.
Do you know anything about building a house?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Queer.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Go tell your father we're eating.
A night in the hole?
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
No, but...
Yeah...
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You know I trust you, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
I got it... boss.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
I've never seen you in here before.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
You're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
This fork is filthy.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
What does that mean?
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
What the hell are you doing?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
I can't eat this.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
You ever done time before?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
All in, boss!
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
What are you doing here, mama?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Apparently, your sister died.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Little Nicky.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Hello, Cassius.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
And give you a good buzz.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Try an angel.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
What is it?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
You sure you're down with this?
So I followed him...
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
You have a dog? What kind?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
No.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
That just hurt a lot.
How do you think we got here??!!
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
What other food?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Had enough?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
That was a great shot you made.
What's your name?
Where do you live, Mary?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Later.
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
What Quad do you live in?
You could have called me yourself.
Maybe... sure...
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Where did you get that?
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
I wish I could help you.
Uh-uh.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Are you taking me to them?
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
I'm afraid.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
How did you get here?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Well? How do you like it?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
Why not?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
In pornos?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
You got him.
You killed him.
Alice...
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
What night is that?
Hey.
The police called us.
Sheila?
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
When he went to work, right.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Do you remember?
I won't ever tailgate.
There's no other bedroom?
Something wrong?
At your house. Don't you remember?
At your house.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I had a dream about you last night...
You're up early.
Don't you want to watch it?
I told you to stay in the car!
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
How ya doin', Pete?
Who is this?
What's goin' on?
Why haven't you called me?
You still care about me?
Sheila?!
I was?
I didn't know you cared.
Cable from Gainsford.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Don't call me brother.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Is it?
He might have lost his way.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Yeah. You know.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Charming chap.
Think of it! In times like these.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Cave, eh? Where?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Who?
108 and still active?
Charming, isn't she?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
What do you want?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
What's she got to do with it?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Where were you hiding?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
I'm thirty.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Why, he's speaking English.
How about you? Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME–
You shot an eight year old girl.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
You do?
I wasn't scared...
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
what's this?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
The radio show?
Jesus...
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
How does that help me?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What do we do?
Yeah ... ?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Nowhere.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
How's Dee?
Kay?  What's your 20?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Take it.
Agatha --
Agatha...
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
John?  What is it?
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
That's not much.
From where?  D.C.?
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Tell me not to worry, John.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We can't grab it...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Somewhere near the capital?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
I scored a goal!
I won!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Okay... now let me time you.
You're alive?
Oh, Sean --
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
What's so funny?
You're talking about the precogs...
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
You said they're destroyed.
Which one is that?
Who?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Congratulations, sir.
Lamar, I found something.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
What?
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
He's trying to prove his innocence.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
Howard --
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any sugar either.
Since right after we lost our son.
What was it then?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
You sure? I just made it.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
It's on West Broadway.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't get it. What do you do?
Should I fuck him?
It's daytime.
So, what kind of gig is this?
Oh my god. What happened?
No coke tonight.  Right?
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Yeah.
How bad is it?
He must have that shit troughed.
This is it.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Yes.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
There won't be a next thing.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Nah.
'Trustafarians?'
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
So, it was a draw.
So, it's not a winning record.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
It's ours.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
How much was it?
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
This is bullshit, man.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know this guy?
So is this the drop?
He woulda told us right?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the fuck was that about?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty five.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Dude, we were practically made...
Kinda. Yeah.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
What's up, man.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
You look good, man.
Yes?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Don't drag my ass into this --
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Ricky.
Is it nice?
You know my pager number?
Sure. You boys want anything?
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
No...
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I am.
I'm working trains. Selling.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Let Billie finish.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
What you say?
What did you give it to me for then?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
What for?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
I'm in Detroit.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
It will be rough.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
Talk about what?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
Get some sleep.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Brother Earl.
I assumed...
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Let him finish.
"His greatest greatness."
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
You know that gal?
'Bout every other night, Red.
Is she hooking?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Yes sir.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Senor?]
Where do I find you?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Who pays you?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Drive.]
Who's he?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[How much do you want?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
Were you provided with a gun?
You mean a misfire?
No.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
What are you doing?
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
You're late.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
The blocks.
Could I ask you a question?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Creasy... Wait.
Last night. Do you know something?
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
I like him, Mom.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
He's not a cop killer.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
You helped him get this job.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
I could see she likes you.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Who you gonna call?
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Who told you that?
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't like her.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Hello, Ralph.
Sure.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Okay.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Wadda you so sore about?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
Where?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
We got to stop them right here.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Is that liquor?
I was just asking...
Gimme three.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I think I heard about that.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Black capsule.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
For you, Trapper.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
You really say the cutest things.
They missed the boat.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
Sir?
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Yeah?
Never mind.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Oh. Yeah.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Can I help you pack?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
The letter from John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Well, maybe you're right.
What's the idea?
Colonel!
Where's Connell?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh—
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Sure, you are.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Four bits.
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I don't get it.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
That's a lie!
Flowers.
She isn't?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Racket? What do you mean?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Is there a crowd in the street?
I don't know.
Floor seats.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What's the line?
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
What?!
You signed out twice.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
That's right.
You don't have to come here.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
It's all there.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
You don't like New York?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
You think you can learn, McCall?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
What did you see?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I'm just practicing my lying.
They need to run first and second?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
There's your answer. He's smart.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
I worship you.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
That a new picture?
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
When?
Korda escaped.
Stay here, don't move.
You crazy? With all those people around?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
And a car.
There are two million people in there with you.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
It's okay.
She said I have a son...
How come I can't remember?
Do you believe in miracles?
But this is impossible.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Dream?!
How long?
What's her name?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
Try harder.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Who did he digitize?
What brings you inside?
You said we were on the same programming team.
But I don't know anything about programming.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
And it meant something.
I'm sorry.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
So how can we get to it?
I heard that!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
That's pretty bad.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
PTERODACTYL!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
I'm in!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we do that?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Hey, boss!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
The goddamned bastards.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You here with Bobby?
You got something to hide?
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Charlie?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I been thinkin'...
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You bastards, I said twenty!
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
I'm glad ya come.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
What the fuck does that mean?
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
What a cozy little scene.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Special occasion?
What?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Back? You're sending me back?
Oh my God...you're proposing?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
What are you watching?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Stu...LOOK!
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Who told you we deal drugs?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
... What are they all doing there?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
How are you doing sweetheart?
Dating anyone?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
What's wrong?
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
What happened?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
You mean it's dangerous?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
You play--left field.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Sam Foley--dead!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
*You won't?*
*But you never asked me*!
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
A pet shop?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Ah, now, that's better.
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
*No*!
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Good. Where are we?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
On paper?
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
Ax?
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
What! Who?
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
No?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Anything *better* to offer?
His first 'whiff'!
Senator Paine will state it!
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's going to be fun.
Yes.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
They think he's pixilated.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Are you married?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Tell me more about yourself.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Sure. I met you.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Oh, I don't know.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
What's the matter, hon?
People have been crucified before.
The guy's balmy.
Look, I can do it!
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
How'd you get the picture?
Sure.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
What're you going to do?
That's the rub.
Come on, come on!
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
He's not home, I tell you!
Must we have the echo?
Your Honor, I object.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Yes. That is to say—
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
We provide opera.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Mrs. Semple?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
No.
Look, he's temperamental.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Where is your farm?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
Yes, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
Hey, did you hear that?
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
I see.
What's that?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
What is it?
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Doc...
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Got a license?  But no car?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Ph.D., psychologist.
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
What can you tell me about this?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Mom's such a cutie.
You're doing great.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
Oh.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
And how does one do that?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
C'mon, friend.
Yeah?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
And what did he say?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
So who's the broad?
No?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Can you swim?
Is he supposed to look like that?
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
I knew you'd know.
Where are you going?
Much less go outside.
Atta, girl!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Superheroes.
And the light goes out...
I'd better go.
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Or talk?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You drink too much.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
There's a big difference.
Nah.
Let's go.
So where's the art?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Are you famous?
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
You did?
Hi.
To us!
It's time.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
There are none here.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
When you eat him, may I have some?
My God...!  What time is it?
When did it start?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Were any of them married?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Yes -- what is it?
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Yes!!
Who is it?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What was there to tell?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Is he alone?
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Stretch it out.
Great moves, Day-Day.
Naw, I already ate.
Me neither.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
You straight?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Who is that?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
You know what this is?
$247.
Blow.
What we gonna do?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You make it sound so easy.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Most definitely.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
You did all this for me?
I did.  Is that door locked?
Can I help you?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
You coming in?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
What kind of activity?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Get 'em, Craig!
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Tape his mouth shut.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
You too big.
I can't feel my legs no more.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Elroy, what happen?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Where'd you come from?
I need your help.
Who did?
Yes, yes, I understand.
What about the gun?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
He's dead?
You killed him.
I killed you.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
But...
I think you better put that away.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
All right. Kisses to you.
Please...
Who?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
What am I supposed to say to her?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
It's under control.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
That's enough.
Any trouble?
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Leavin', boy?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Who?
What can we do, Mother?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
It's all here.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
I'm hungry, John.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Are we goin' home, John?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Tell me what, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
All right boy: where's the money?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Sure, that's no secret.
John's bad.
Can I have milk too?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Mister Powell?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Harry!
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Oh my god, oh my god...
You okay?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
You believe in anything?
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
What!?
Meanwhile...?
Decide to take a day off after all?
Hello Nancy.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Where you think you're going?
What?
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Screw sleep!
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Someone else was there.
No.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Nice to have a fire.
What you dream?
No more fights?
What is it, Ninotchka?
From Leon.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
What are you serving?
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Well, a hat...
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You wouldn't like Razinin.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
Comrade Buljanoff...
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Good evening, Your Highness.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
What's new?
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
You want me to go in there?
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Yes!
On what?
You, please.
Can I help you?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
What do we do now?
I will start with you.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Thank you.
I must go.
Then do it through my lawyer!
Room service speaking.
I didn't follow you.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
Just smile.
Because we are an odd couple.
Not funny, huh?
You see? Life can be so simple.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
How do you do?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
Not white, darling.
...and we won't clench our fist...
Would that make you any happier?
What shall we get? The news!
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Hello, Leon!
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Thank you.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
All right, I'll listen.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
She's gone, Leon.
Hello, Leon darling!
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
That's all right... I grow on people.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Where are they?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Unfortunately.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Where to, madame?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
At Père Mathieu's.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
It's a code or something.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
McCord? ...
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
The country's loving it.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Sorry ...
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
No, sir, you did not.
About a dozen.
That was civil war.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Their fourth!
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
I can't ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Mom expects great things from you ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Are you tapping Kissinger?
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Ummm...
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
You're fucking me.
Who we working for?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
So, what's this about, Dick?
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
... as the old alliances crumble.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
You all right?
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
We got the press this time!
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
What's in there?
Proud?
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
I'll do it.  No more.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Were you planning to tell me?
Congratulations, Dick.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Won or lost?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
Yes.
Well what would you call him.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Yes ma'am, I do.
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
But you don't believe it.
We goin' in?
Probably must be.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
How's that, Sheriff?
...This month's checks.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I thought it was a car afire.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
No.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
What's in the satchel?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
Big talk.
Llewelyn.
What're you doin', baby?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
What should I do?
And where is that.
I can't say.
Hello?
Huh? What is...
Mm-hm.
Airport.
Who is this.
All right.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Is somethin' wrong?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Yes I do.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
Call it.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Tent poles.
What kind of tent?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Good. I need everything else.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
It's all right.
What do you want to know?
...I'm wondering...
What about one forty-two.
Then you'll like me.
What did you do?
Cast iron?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Are you in the service?
Nam?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
...I meant your food.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You should get the order you want.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Jesus...
Bad idea...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
A woman can write a check.
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Need something else?
Who are these idiots?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Do you know why I'm here?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
What?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
You never gave us a chance...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I have... did it sound that bad?
George...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Uh-huh.
What're you doing here, Roy?
Yes.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
What are you doing?
You're hurting him!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
Rosa...
...this is your sweater, right?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
Really. And where was that, old man?
What do you mean?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
That's right.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
We can live with that.
Joyce was screwing Del.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
Who's this?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
I see.  May I?
Seems like a nice place.
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
...Pete?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
How'd he know about the treasure?
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Pete have a brother?
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
A miracle! It was a miracle!
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Who was fixing to betray us!
But...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
It was a powerful air.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Okay, okay. You win.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
I know.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
What did you call me, Mayo?
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Sid, there's no baby.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
You stayed after all.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hi.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'm looking for Sid.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Could you believe those girls!
You okay?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
No problem.
What if she called the cops?
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
You should see the look on your face.
Yes.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's gonna handle it.
That's your problem.
Asshole.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
What do you want?
You don't look so good.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Could the child please stop that?
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
A what?
That's highly inappropriate.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
We're leaving.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Something's weird.
Too many stairs.
Shoulda got an apartment.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What?!
Damn it!
What if they get in here?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Why did the chicken cross the road?
We're never getting out of here.
What?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Well... is it loaded?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What's up?
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Rodgers... this is no good...
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Rose?
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Congratulations.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
I know him well enough?
How did this... how did I let this happen?
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Of course, I do.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Their names, ranks and posts?
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Did your father teach you humility?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Don't go in there.
No, I don't.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Who's in command?
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Reverend.
Gray.
That bad?
Father?
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Ellie? What's wrong?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Do you swear?
Hey--they actually found the place!
What were you listening to?
What?
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Rachel not feeling well?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Gage's gone!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Well, honey...you know that...
I'm going to try to do better.
How does he do that?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
I'll watch my back.
The situation has changed.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
I knew it.
Why would my father send this to me?
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That was before I met one, of course.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
What's your name?
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Who makes all these?
You cheated.
Move away.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Not without my effects.
Come aboard.
It's still against the law.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Is that so?
I swear, you look just like him.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
No.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Jack!
You haven't seen it.
He may be.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Did you feel that?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Yeah, I do!
Yeah?  So what?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What did security say?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Yes?
Like Crazy Glue?
When did you...?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
No cheese.
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
God, what a fight that was.
You!  I remember you!
That's impossible.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
I could have you fired right now.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
What do you want?
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
I suppose you're going to print them?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
You wear them of course, silly.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
That's an excellent idea.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Look, I quit!
Right - for the first time this year.
Come on, get going, get going!
It has been alleged - yes—
Not on my own beat, no.
Why not?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Araby?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
Who are you?
You're my what?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
All right, outside!
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
The boss is getting hoarse.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
What do you know about Conrad?
What could I be?
Hey, Gallagher!
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
Yes.
No. I want to know.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
It's okay. It's alright.
Wait.
Thank you.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
Wait ...
What is that?
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
It's six-thirty ...
I'm busy.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Dan! Arrest them!
Pleasantville Marathon?
What did you do?
Noooooo!
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Who's that?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
Are you sure?
You got the admissions letter.
Keeps going ...
So what's it like?
Can I open it?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Bud?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Have you cooked the burgers?
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Aren't you a little early?
It's an art book.
What's wrong?
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Free?
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Are you gonna do it?
Yeah I can't.
Yes.
Sure.
....no....
No.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
It was cool last night.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Hi.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
What do you do with all this pudding?
Oh My God.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
This is funny.
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
No I didn't say that.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Are you learning how to play it?
Hi.
I don't freak out.
Yeah?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Do you wanna have sex?
That's right you travel so much.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
I'm sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
No.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
You want her to call you Jack?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
Can we agree that that is that?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
What's up?
....now: this pudding?
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
I'm sorry.
As soon as you want.
Your expenses are your own.
That's it.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
We should be going --
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Go back to your room. Quickly.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
You mean to take us all down with you?
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Who's to say I did not?
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
And he's never once attempted escape?
Well?
As you say, Doctor.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
I'll be waiting.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Did I frighten you?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
Good God, Marquise --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
That poor woman.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Uh-huh
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
It's not really--
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You are repellant when you drink.
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
Keep filming.
You drink at 10 am, do you?
I wanna see the picture today
Hearst?
Nope.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
The great Spanish bullfighter
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Oh for Christ's sake-
This better be good
Sorry to disappoint.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Let me out.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
It's 350 pages long.
I want you back
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
It came.
You're going to destroy it
You're lying to me.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
Oh God. . .
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
This looks done.
You're a good sport, lady.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Who's that?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Yeah --
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Huh?
With her? How?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
You want us to wait for you?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Whatcha doin'?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
See? That's all there was to it.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Nine o'clock.
Three more, I figure.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Now, touch me...  ...here.
But, Jake, I was just...
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
What's the matter with you?
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake --
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Like disposing of their wives?
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Jewelry?
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Read some good books.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Jeff --
Hello.
I can't. The police have it by now.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
People have different emotional levels that --
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Keep your mind off her.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Mrs. Thorwald?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
What do you need money for?
Yes.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
How can you tell that -- from here?
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Maybe she died.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I wonder where he's going now?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
From his landlord -- once a month.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
The same.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Wasn't that close?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
L. B. Jefferies.
What's that?
Machismo?
Any other entrance?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
What would you do, Dad?
Blood.
Excuse us a minute?
I was talking to Jim.
Frank!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Come back tomorrow.
You remember me?
What's your name!
You scared?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
It's me!
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
No.
Can I keep it?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I shot at one of them.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
What a zoo!
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
The kids take me.
Goodbye!  See you!
You still pretty upset?
Why did you do that?
Where you going?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Well--we're newlyweds.
You can't talk underwater!
How many rooms do you think there are?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
No!
What's he like?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Hi, Plato!
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
She's being called for.
How did you know that?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Is this him!?
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Gabriel, you promised!
You promised me!
Searching for a money man...
I've been doing good, though.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Gabriel!
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Do that again.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Where the hell are you going?
You forget where I work?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
Nick died for me....
Gabriel!
He working for them on this one?
Get your own room, Ashley.
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
He says he wants it now.
No.
But I never said Rudy.
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
What's her middle name?
So what the hell good are you...
They won't recognize me.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Do I get a country-western name?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
That motherfucker --
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
What the hell was that about --
Monsters in the gelatin...
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
She's using a new perfume.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Do what?
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Without having them hit the alarms.
Alone at last.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I'll call somebody.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Who, Mr. White?
What?
But what is this?
Jesus Christ!
Just hold on buddy boy.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
How is he?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What're you talkin' about?
Why?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Dead.
As opposed to good?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm cool.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Why!
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Who shot who?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Our kind of women?
There's a nice boy.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
But the rest is right.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Tell me, darling.
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
I can't --
That's right.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Why?
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
What did you come back for?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
I can't take her with me.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Stop it -- stop it.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
What's the matter -- restless?
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
We don't want to go there.
Go on. Have another try at him.
We might as well start a fire.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Good night, Miss Wells.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Aren't we stayin'?
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Ouch!!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Hello Brenda.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Hi Buddy.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Where the hell are we?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
What about you, Buddy?
He's here.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Cindy, let me...
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
What should we get?
Okay, I get the point.
Oh, right.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
I'm sorry.
You could use the grade, huh?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
I don't like this, this...
Here you go, Professor.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Professor, we need to talk.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Would you like to see the girl?
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
What does it say?
"Ray!"
Did you hear?
What a bitch!
0h, shit!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
CHIP!!
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Hi, Hank.
Shhhh..
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
It's him!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
You got your wish.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
What was that?
What is it, Betty?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
Let's get out of here.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
But tell me --
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Redi's all right.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I'm going to find your sister.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
She'll have to know some time.
Please, Jacqueline.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
Yes. When I tell you.
Perhaps.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
Would they hurt her?
But you would like to know where she is?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Yes.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Because I have something very important to do.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
No, not really.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Does it bother you?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Aren't you?
What are these?
What about sex?
You just ask them questions?
And they just answer them?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
That's a good question.
Yes.
Yes, I have. I will.
So you do fantasize?
About who?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
On tape?
Her name was Elizabeth.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Subtlety?
You're really never going to make love again?
But if you were?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I can't.
I've told you.
But that was part of it?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
John?
What?
Bastard...
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What visitor?
No, he left last week.
What do you mean, like physically?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
Fine.
No, I didn't.
Questions about sex.
Apparently.
Yes, I did.
What!?
He wouldn't do that.
No, but I did.
Why?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
So what's my share of the dress?
The extrovert.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
How do we start?
How long will it take?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Do you like the way I look?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
I would.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
When?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Hi, John.
What tapes?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
God, you need help.
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Jesus!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
You knew these people?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Want me to breathe deeply?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
Yeah? What do I do then?
BREAKING OUT
In a way...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
Mental instability?
I'd forgotten.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Could I do that later?
Oh my poor baby.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Poor Brad.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I'm...happy.
I want to see Brad.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
That's an extremely negative response.
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Miles.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Are you there? Miles?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Hi.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Just tell me.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
What do you smell?
We should have driven.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Sure I know Maya.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
We're on.
So what should I wear?
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
What?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
What's that supposed to mean?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Me?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Well. That about does it.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Oh yeah? How is it?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
So what's your novel about?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Okay. See you around.
I had class.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Hello?
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That's great.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It makes me feel better.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
The same windows.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
Pharmacy crowded?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was only a year and half old.
Merrill --
Merrill!
It's getting stronger.
How do they know it's over?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Don't touch him.
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What about Isabelle?
What's that?
You said something was strange. What's strange?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Forget it.
Gotta go.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Women?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'll see you around.
Never will again.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
The jury saw it differently.
Hello, Rae.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why come to me?
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
He must be pretty good.
What brings you into my saloon?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
And I know what I'm talking about.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What is it that I can't figure?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
The public decides who's on that list.
Why isn't she with you?
Why not?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
... Simone.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
You're with me to be close to her?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Absolutely not!
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Not quite how I imagined it --
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
She thinks you're with Simone.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Do I know you?
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
You love her, don't you, Max?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
You mean they buy it?
I am the death of real.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
Where should I look then, Cole?
Why?
What'd you write?
Yes.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Yes?
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
Just help.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
You know that accident up there?
Where is she?
They?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
...He doesn't get invited places.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Could take a little while, though.
Aha. The Lovers.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Curt Cobain.
Are you crazy?
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
He means moon shining.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
It's time to make amends.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Down boy.
Chicken sandwich?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
What's wrong?
Wait a minute --
You're... limping.
No --
No Mac, please... I --
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
What is it?!!
Carl.
Someone better tell Mac.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
What?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Pretty, ain't they?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
That wasn't a good night, no.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
What?
Hey there, Chief.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Flip.
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
I loved you. I loved --
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Kate McConnell.
But you could get killed, right?
An existentialist.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Where you from?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Jesus!!!
Yeah.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
An unmarked police car.
I'm proud of you.
My very words.
What kind of a guy is he?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
I'm begging.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Order up!
Or in the slammer.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
How long's this gonna take?
Loud and clear.
Shit! No one's here.
We still on schedule?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Bandit?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
We're outta motion lotion.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
-- How we doing?
How's the clock, Bandit II.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
Did he give you his name?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
But there were more of you?
...I forgive you Darwin.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Really?
Man, that's great.
What happened?
Yeah, we've been through that.
D'you talk to'm?
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
I can't discuss --
...When did you know all this?
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- never in a million girl --
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
What's wrong?
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
You'll end up like me.
What happened to Gibarian?
I want to hear your version.
That's fantastic.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Perhaps it did.
They come when you sleep.
What plan?
I need to see Snow.
Don't.
We're taking a flight?
Not a very happy poem.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
What's wrong.
Was she right?
You're the coward.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
Do you want to stay here?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
You never said you wanted one.
I think they help.
It's terrific Win.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
Are you nervous?
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
What about Neil?
What's to like?
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Stop being nuts!
You don't want to know.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
When can I see you?
Do you?
... Mike.
Everyone's all right...?
So.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Tommy...!
Mike?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
So how'd it go?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Hey.  The neighbors.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Why?
Coming to bed?
Mike, take it easy...
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you do tonight?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Let me drive...
What about when she goes out?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
What about when she identifies him?!
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
At my house...!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Are you in charge here?
Hold it...!
How do I know that's her?
Why should she come in?
Nice threads Dad.
How about dinner tonight?
Sexual tension...
Here you go, Pete.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Flash, get lost.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
You get mugged or something?
Now tell me you love me.
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Yeah--
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
You should write that one down.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hello, Liz.
Waldos.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
I'm a photographer, remember?
The record--
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Mr. Parker.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Need any more help?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
So they're airing this tonight?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
They never caught on.
What's wrong with him?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Have a cigar.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Break it off!
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
You are being rude again.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
To the Brick Kremlin!
What do those broads say?
I'll open mine now.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
What about Schulz?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
You taking Dunbar?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The what?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Captain=8A
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
That's where he's going.
Population?
What?
Data, are you all right?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Well, may we have a look around?
We don't have a tractor beam.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Oh
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Captain, are you all right?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Doctor Soran?
You must think I'm quite the madman.
The royal...studs?
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Response?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
David, I don't understand...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Why?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
I don't understand.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott...
Mr. Scott?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
May I ask why...?
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
David?... David!
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
No.
Genesis, I want it.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me your hand and we both live.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
I -- saw no future --
Then, how --
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
Bones!...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
My Lord... what are your orders?
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
You amaze me, Commander.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Physician, heal thyself.
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
It never rains but when it pours --
Khan could be down there!
They even killed the galley chief.
But what if they went -- nowhere?
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Wait --
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I told you! I told you I saw a --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't expect anything.
It was just words.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
They're still running with shields down.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
And who is this?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
They knew just where to hit us.
Not enough against their shields.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
A distinct possibility.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Yes.
Indeterminate life signs.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Fire all phasers...!
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Bones, stay here.
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You're joking...!
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Ah, well done, team 2.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Thanks.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
How will that be done, exactly?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Here... In the park?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
... What does that mean?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Permission to come aboard.
Spock...?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Status?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Ready sir.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Transparent aluminum?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
A perfect moment?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Don't you ever get tired?
Really.
Do machines ever play?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Hello, Data...
Yes... that looks like them.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
A ship,
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
What kind of concerns?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Full impulse.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Deck five.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Worf, you must hurry...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Counselor?
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
It's Cochrane.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Yes...
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Can you configure it?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Jean-Luc Picard.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What do you want?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
I'd say you already have.
Friends from Cornell...
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
What are they doing?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf? Is something wrong?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Even Data?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
No!
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
This is fun...
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Retire.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
And what did they tell you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
An INCIDENT?
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
And your coat.
How did you know...?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Sorry -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Just the prototype.
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Where?
What the -
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Any progress?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Praxis?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
NO WAY!
A computer canna lie, sir.
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
I do not understand.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
When was he... created?
Beverly, come in.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
So... To happy endings.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Yes, sir.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
How long until we reach the fleet?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
You have a red shirt.
Why?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
It's you.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
What's he doing?
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
With or without the rest of the fleet?
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
To find the head, sir?
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
We need to talk, just you and I.
You don't trust me.
Were we always explorers?
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
All of this so you could capture me?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
So they’ve got him up and running.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Are we prepared?
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Benny, God, take it easy...
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
I'll take that.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Clarify that.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
George... Do you hear me, George?
Mrs. Haydn...
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Please...
Please.
What?
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Closed?
What?
Who?
I am husband?
No.
In your pocket, please...
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Money.
What's the matter?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
What happened?
The captain...
I am not a good singer.
You liked my singing?
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I will go. But not you.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Asshole!!
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
The yellow one.
Help me!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Slow down, slow down.
I don't know where he is.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I don't understand.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
No.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Let's work it.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Top ten.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Jesus.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
So there never was a death squad.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
It's alright.  He means it.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
I thought we were friends.
No it doesn't.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Whatup Lenny?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Take it to him.
What is that?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
You tell me.
Dylan here.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Look, mister...
What did he look like?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I'm hesitant to...
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
There was talk of a file photo.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You okay?
All the same killer?
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
What was your weakness, sir?
Suspect Zero?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
I've been to Chicago.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Koessler?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
You have to put things in perspective.
Ever since I've known you.
Are you calling Her?
Thanks.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Well, thank you...?
Like the quiche?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Anything?
They're out of Glenlivet.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
Do you have anything smaller?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Sorry, it's just that...
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...Which one...?
Hi. Sorry about that.
How's it going? It's been a while...
How are you doing?
I miss you, Mike.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Oh.  Where is this place?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Sounds more like Aids...
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
There are so many beautiful women here.
I got to at least try once.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
You little bitch!
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
She was cute.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Mike?
That's right.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
VEGAS.
Tonight, baby.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Double down.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
You think so?
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Oh... a Dorothy.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Christy was nice...
I don't think so.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
...a day...
What are you doing?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
We got the digits, baby.
Tomorrow?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...shivering...
...You're just poking at it...
...honestly...
It is on.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Be my friend.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think we'll go for that last place?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Barzini will move against you first.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Don Tommassino.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Beautiful all over, eh?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Ever seen anything like that before?
Who are those girls?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Mike, why am I out?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
What time do they expect us?
Michael.
He'll be OK.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
A million times.
What is it?
Do you wish to be baptized?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
He's drowning me!
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Who is it?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Tom.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Are you okay?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Very.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
It's all true.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
What?
What's your secret?
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
What?
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
Will we see you later?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
I've been backpacking.
No.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Not guilty.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
How was it?
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
I don't remember the exact date.
Thank you.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
You got a .44 Magnum?
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Well, we're all working tonight.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Really?
The moon?
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
The DMZ?
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
You must be rich.
You know what you remind me of?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
This is sort of high class...
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
How long has he been there?
This I gotta see.
Oh, are you all right?
He's Black, OK?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, I'm serious, really...
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
For a fee.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Stick up?
Where.
What's your name?
What's your real name?
Listen...
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
No.
Twenty-six.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Not really.
No.
Spit it out.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Motor oil?
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
What, vou?
What are you doing?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
What.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
City hall?
You first.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Whoa.
I'm sorry.
We were in love... weren't we?
Nine hundred...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
They're not bad.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Your dancing's very good.
Sir, that is true.
Yes, sir.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
No wallet, huh?
Mother o'god...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Nine and-a-half years ago.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
But I...
Ernie.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
You bet.
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Luke... what time is it?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Evening, Luke.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
You can't testify.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Is there a young Tim?
That's my r-r-rent.
Ancestors?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Would you like some brandy?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I did.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
What?
No, it's Lois!
Where does he live?
Yes, but where?
The two kids?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
It's a surprise, you see.
The little girl's name.
Thank you.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Oh. I see.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
When do you think they'll come?
Where will we go?
Mother, get a rope!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
We won't be here.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Sixty...  Oh.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
I think you're a louse.
Ouch!
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Yes.
Can't see a thing.
Certainly, but...
Why did he shoot her?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Will I be seeing you again?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Last night? What do you mean?
Some cream?
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
What do you mean?
Melanie...
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
What time is it?
You must be exhausted.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Have you got a pencil?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
For what purpose?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Help how? What do you want to do?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Scotch, light on the water.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Mr. Gray?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
See that, Fettes?
Are you a doctor, too?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
But what makes a thought start?
This is a gift you'll not return.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
I would make you rich.
Can anyone hear what we say?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Two down. Two to go.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Think maybe knives do?
Fuck! What do you want?
I heard you were looking for this.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Erin. It's not your fault.
No. You don't.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
... it connects you to me...
Fucking crow.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Look, can I just call a cab?
What? What is it?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Are you an FBI man?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
You think they'll ever find him?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No foolin'? Will you?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
How does he explain that?
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
You know about the United Nations?
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I wonder if we ought to--
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
I want to know what he told you last night.
No. That's all finished.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
How do you like Santa Carla?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
I don't like horror comics.
Why not?
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
They're gaining on us!
We still going?
I can't beat a Triumph.
I'm my own man.
Where's Star, David?!
With him?
Or a vampire.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
What's that smell!?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Ouch, my hair...
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Good!
I'll hitch.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Ocean air!
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Tell them to get something to eat.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
What did you say?
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Not impressed, are you?
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
I am?
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
Why not?
Then it's not too late for us...
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
You're beautiful.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Now why'd you go and...
Too damn dangerous.
How you doin', old boy?
What?
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
What do we do about those three?
You ain't tying me up.
Not the only one.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Well, who's got access to it?
I guess you're okay.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
After all this mess then.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
How long's it been?
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
What if it doesn't come?
Where was he trying to go?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
You hear that?
What do you do on the towers?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
You know of them?
Do you know where they live?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Why did they built it?
No, we created the Morlocks.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
Why would you let me go back?
Now will you go?
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Dance with me...
Alex...?!
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
In the future, we'll be better.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
I can't do that --
You won't say that in a week.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
How long did you travel?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Oh, that explains everything.
That machine --
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Yes.
Yes!
I don't understand.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
He said he traveled for two months.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
You know that's not true.
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
What did you do at night?
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Sir?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
He's recovering on the third floor.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Yes.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
How did you come to know their names?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
What should they be looking for?
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I looked it up.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
What? What are you thinking?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
No. I don't want it to.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
What were you talking about the other day?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
Becker does? Are you sure?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
What's this?
You want a drink?
This is a great song.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
I'm sorry.
Hon.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Darryl.
Honey?
On what?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Did you get married real young?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
That sounds nice.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
You're a bank robber?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Tell me.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Tell me now.
Hey, peaches.
Will you at least see how it fits?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Oh my God.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
But you think he fools around.
Will I be?
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
So what are you gonna tell him?
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Drive!  Drive away!
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You think you've found your calling?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?
What?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
What?
Ready?
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Louise?
Thelma, that is not an option.
You awake?
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can live in a hacienda.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
You're a good friend.
What in the hell is that up there?
You women are crazy!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
No harm, no foul?
I'm asking you to leave.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Mary again.
Whatever happened to Mary?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Mary's a babe!
No You mean...?
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Got cash.
Check.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Nineteen months I been sober.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Oh yeah.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
How'd you know that?
Are you... an architect?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
A surprise?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Are you okay?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All you want is a phone number?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
She's blackmailing you, right?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Hey, hey, hey!
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
You know, I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Ho-ly shit.
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
I can live with those reflections.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
What's he like?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
An old flame?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Magda!
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up, Doc?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
So who you taking to the prom?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Sure.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Please leave.
It.
Is it the frank or the beans?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
No! I was pissing!
Franks and beans!
Starshells.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Slow down. Smell that?
Yeah?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Max.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Bob?
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Hey.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Couldn't sleep.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
What are you --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
What's he smoke in that?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
That's not solid.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Still after Jimmy?
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Where was this?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
What's that?
Jesus. Oil?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Thank you.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
X22. Read.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Washington sent ya. I know that.
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
I'll bet!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Where did you see that?
What would?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.
You're horrible
You ever think about killing another human being?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
I want it understood.
Lucky charm.
Now?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Well?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Yes, Sergeant?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Ohhh Mother!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Is there something I should know?
Is it the plane?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What was that?
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
I've lost him -- where is he?
We did it!
It's a victory roll.
What the hell is this?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
Mav's a great flyer but....
A plaque?
Hear about Ice?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET LOST!
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
ON THE NOSE?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Figured it out yet?
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
I've seen this before.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
You won?!!!
He's a good pilot.
I can take care of myself.
I called your house.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Would you take me back? Would they?
So, where to?
What happened to them?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Would you like the same suite?
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Kill him.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
What do you want?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
What is it?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Sit down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
...You mean it?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Well...What do you say?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
And falling in love?
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Clever girl.
I love you.
Right.  Mars.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
All right.
...What?
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
I'm not falling for it.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
What can I do?
Like what?
He's lying.
Wait!
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Knock it off, Burt!
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
You're really leaving, huh?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
Prairie dog burrow...
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Watch your ass, shithead.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Road's in!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah...but no ties.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Down, honey, down.
Burt!  Heather!
What?
Twenty.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
...Where're we goin'?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Ms. Vin's sister.
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
I noticed.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
How can you remember that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- an angel dust dealer --
-- a speed manufacturer --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
-- Easy as that, huh?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Murder witness.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
What went down?
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What do you want?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Let's ditch this place and party.
We can do it right here.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Yes...
HE'S GONE.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
He didn't suffer.
No.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
The usual, 9:15.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Are you going to see James tonight?
Oh god, Laura.
Laura?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Right on time, baby.
It does matter. We're in love.
We were supposed to be together.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Where's Dad?
Dad.
No.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland, what are you doing?
Leland...
Did you get this from your lover?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Yes.
What is the truth?
You know what that would mean?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
I do. Yes.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Ed Concannon.
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
She getting good care over there?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Dr. Gruber...
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
The most respected...
Thank you.
Kathy Price...
What did she say?
One hour.
A single hour.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
I object, your Honor...
D'you find an apartment?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Is it over?
Thank you.
Hello, I'm calling from...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...You saw her?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Dr. Gruber.
Another, Frank...?
Well, well, well. Huh?
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
Who have we got?
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
That's right.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...yeah... good...
She told me.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
You look kinda lost yourself.
Did you see it come down?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
How does it happen cars are running?
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
What was it like?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
That needle ain't pointing north!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
They'll understand us, all right!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He's had some sort of...episode.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Yes.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Doctor...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
DO you mind...
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
You okay, champ?
What...what is that?
You okay?
Darker.  More...evil?
You're not crazy, by the way.
You didn't jump in.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Is Chase Porter your husband?
I want to see the body.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Then what is he doing?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Why did we begin this?
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
There's still a way.
Where's Mom?
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Fine.
Albatross?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Ninety-six.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Why then.
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
I feel like I got you into this.
No way!
What'd you do?
It works?
Northeast sir!
You all right?
Well, spit it out.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
What?  Come on...
It matters to me.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Tie it off!!
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
About yourself?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Swing up, son.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
What's Cao Ben?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Need a hand?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
That is my permiso.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
What is it, Johnnie?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
In a fire, as I recall.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
What's that honey?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Actin' funny how?
...are followin' him around.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
What was this one?
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
How much we got left, honey?
What's that, peanut?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
It's a comfortin' idea.
There's worse places, honey.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
That you, Sail, honey?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
He's the kind liked it.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
LULA!!!!
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Just a place.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Course I am, mama.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I knew you'd want it again...
Get rid of him?
You need to explain it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Explain it... I told you.
Where? In the leg?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
What?...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
By who?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
I know... I remember.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
He's fine. He's narrating.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
It's the Chancellor.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
He said something about being between things.
Is that just beer?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He has a book.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Tripp?!
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Kidnapped? By who?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
How bad is it for you?
Which is?
Who do you think it is?
Want some help with that?
Naturally you have copies.
No...
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I know.
She told you about...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Better luck next time.
Vernon.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Hello?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Goodbye, Grady.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
The guy on the phone.
Professor Tripp?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Who?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
It's warm.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
You coming?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
It's because you don't eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Professor Tripp.
New?
You go first.
Emily left me this morning.
Is that Cristaile?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Who's gun is that?
Pow.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Oh?
And what do you think you might have said?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I lost it all.
I know.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Who's he barking at now?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Hardapple?
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
What party?
Ah, come on.
Soon.
C'mon, Walter.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
What do you mean?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
Cherry?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
You walked home.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
You knew her?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
The passionate one?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
But you are taking it?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Just trying to be helpful.
Walter.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
What's her name?
And how's your job?
Why not?
I don't understand.
It was just an idea.
It's very good, indeed.
Then why are you talking about this?
You couldn't say.
How do you define it?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
When did it all start?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Who do you see?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Sorry.  Where is she?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I'm only asking questions.
What else?
There's something wrong with this picture.
You're quiet at work.
You never spoke to me before.
You plan to drink both those beers?
Is that a school?
What about bears?
So?
Do you?
So, what did you do?
Sorry.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
I've changed.
You know, this is crazy.
I got poked around... here and there.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
It's a bad idea.
I say we call it quits.
Don't be scared, Walter.
You okay?
Nice shot, Lins.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
You wanna know what I think?
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
What's the scoop, ace?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Virgil?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
SHIT!
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
What kind of light?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Did you sleep well?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Have you ever been in love?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Who are you talking to?
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
What happened?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
And what are we going to do now?
And who is this?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
You men are all so dreadful!
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Yes.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
It's a sin to be fat.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
But she watches... she listens.
Of God.
I don't know.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Who?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
You've been alone together?
Often?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
I... I don't understand.
Where do you think babies come from?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
What things?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
How?
Yes?
She tells you you're ugly?
That you're a mistake?
Oh, yes.
Are you intelligent?
You're a mistake.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
What is it?
A wastepaper basket.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Which one?
She'd seen him too.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
Stay away from me...
No...
I hate him...
H... how?
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I don't know.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Yes.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You were a smoker?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Shortly after she came to us.
It's my affair too.
???  
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
Visitors to the convent.
Your niece!
Do you know what she did to her?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
We'll see about that.
Because I am a moral person.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Mary Magdelen?
I'd like to begin.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Hasn't she had enough?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Too late for what?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Lay them down.
They're yours.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
You don't think...
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
I don't snore.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Grotty?
I beg your pardon?
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Did you look in here?
Sure. .
Ringo!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Gear?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
And what do you do about it?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
What are they saying?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
And we're looking after him, are we?
Come on let's get this coffee.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
What's he know?
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Now get on with it.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
That's what you tell me.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Temper! Temper!
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
None for me, then?
Eh, what's all this?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Are you in pain?
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Close enough to walk to!
I'll go first.
What's up?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
How do you feel, Dell?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Breathe deeply.
Computer, what language was that?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
How long to fix?
Hello, Faust!
You know what they make this stuff out of?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Where's it coming from?
What the hell's going on?
Hurt!  How?
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
And when will you be ready to do that?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
Where did it come from?
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
He's running a fever.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
It will be.
What?  What was that?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Look at that.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
This is horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Blow the ship up?
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
What's wrong?
This looks ancient.
<u>What is it</u>?
Oh God, oh God no.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Oh my God.
It's out of focus.
Not a one.  It's dead.
But?
Here, Chaz.
What film?
Yes!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
Let's hear it.
That'll blow the ship up.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
Kill me...
No... don't...
Yeah, it's fine.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Minh...
What do you need?
Are you alright?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
Oh, man...
How much air-time have I got?
Listen to what?
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
What the hell are you doing?
Hold it, hold it...
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
And...?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
They've changed their heading again.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
So, what do you think?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Jesus.
Hello, there. Who are you?
And what is your name?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
What a day - what a heavenly day...
What time?
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You sat and talked until it was light...
Champion to champion.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I don't think I'm going.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
Margo? Lunching in public?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
Good luck, genius...
Macbeth.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Many happy returns of the day...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
It's a good thought.
Need any help?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
When I'm guest of honor?
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So she seems.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance what?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
I must have frightened her away.
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Don't be condescending.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Never try to outguess Margo.
With the paper to prove it.
Hello, what's your name?
Just wondered what?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
So few come back...
Every day.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Find out.
Lemme fix you a drink.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Birdie-
An answer.
Why not?
She's loyal and efficient-
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
You probably won't believe me.
That's the door.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
I think she would cheer.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
But the raves about your performance-
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
She knows enough not to be here.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Did you see it here in New York?
What - again?
The curtains. I made them myself.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
I'd like to hear it.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
He's in love with you.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
It's just possible she didn't...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Miss Caswell?  What?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
Carl?
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
All right, what do we know?
Hey?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
That was fun.  What now?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
'68.
Did he just say what I think he said?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Goddamnit--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
What would you have done?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--jeeeeeeesus--
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
I'll never get out of here in time.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
--no--
What's a real denial?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
No games, Irwin; give.
But they both worked at the White House?
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
Just tell me his title.
I got Clawsen on hold--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
They are not my clients.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
How grand?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Where?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Who's Charles Colson?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
So?
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
That was awhile ago.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
Go on.
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
What the hell was that?
Good work, Ostreicher.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Me too.  For the most part.
Not bad, Chris.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Nice car.
What?  No I'm not.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
That's not why we're going out.
No.
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
There's our man.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
But, but -- what would I do?
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
What the heck is this?
Dad!  I know!
Yes dad.
Dad.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
This was remade?  Into what?
Who cares?
Yes.
Uh...
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Oh, Kev.
Tonight?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
About the other day...I've been thinking.
See -- this is the nicest room.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
That was a great night.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
What reputation?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Salots! Shitfucker!
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
What about your glasses?
Serafine...
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
God. I can't believe it.
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Nothing's happening!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy...
Not you too -
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Uncle Terrence?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Why would he pick this one?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Enough. Cut him loose.
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
What've you got?
Well?
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Who did you hear it from?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Forged papers! Now, what?!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Every Russian family has one..
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Oh! I'm sorry...
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
Do you remember this?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
What was that?
What do we do now?
How is our current financial status?
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
You are the boy ...
She does.
I had nothing to do with it!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Can I have your autograph?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Well... thank you again.
Fifteen years?
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Duane?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Fifteen years, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
what I mean?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
Those are the two categories...
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
That's the key question.
Don't you think I do?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
What are you doing?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
M'hm.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Two?
Oh, Jesus, really?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, but it's real close.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You look very pretty.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Alvy.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Oh, you got a headache!
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
Who said that?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Charlie Chaplin.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Well, sit down.
You wanna lie down?
How about a ginger ale?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
You fired the cleaning woman?
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
No, no, no, not at all.
Oh.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
There were many men interested in you?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
Isn't Skye amazing?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
I don't know how to make her funny.
What what's about?
Honey?
I'm not.
Oh.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Just did.  Jealous?
But she's alright.
I call that a perfect day.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
No luck.
What?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I mean, you're really back.
What?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Yes.
Dolphins.  Great.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
She left the fucking gate open.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Fuck you.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It's not like this all the time.
And how hard it hit?
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
It's a shit novel anyway.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
I know.
Coffee?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
It's a novel.
Not long.
And I you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Please, Ryan.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
I'm a little nervous, so...
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Are you okay?
What am I, five?
Yes.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
Of course it's alright.
What?
Are you making an ass of yourself?
I don't need a drug.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I'm so sorry.
I...
Do you need anything else?
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
How?
You're a shit.
So tell me, how's it going?
You don't need to do that.
She's such a great photographer.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
I don't have a drug problem.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
Break's over.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
You're right!
And you are...?
I order you to find out where we are!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Who is that idiot?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
...Not enough food?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
ARREST HIM!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
What do you see out there?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
What did I tell you?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
What did you do to your hair?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
No.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Here.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Who?
When are you coming home?
Your stomach?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Too slow?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Who was that?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I would.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
I see you bought some napkins.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
Oh.
Mind if I come in?
Last night?
Would you mind repeating the question?
Who?
How do you work it with the key?
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
You know how people talk.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
To me?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yeah --
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
No key!
Now hold on, Baxter --
Baxter?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
Mr. Sheldrake?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
You can't come in.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Want to tell me what happened?
Help yourself.
Yeah, wasn't I?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
What for?
I missed you, Fran.
It's been hell.
I don't believe you.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
What do you think?
I have that date -- remember?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Now, Fran --
Coming?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We need all our fuel anyway.
What !
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
How about a drink ?
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
Rangers, eh?
Arch light.
Chef.
Why they call you that?
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Well, get in there.
I --
What cat  ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Captain?
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
They far enough?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Can you trust them?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Don't you agree?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Do you know me?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's yours?
Go away -- hide yourself.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Were you with him, when...
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
What?
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
What show ?
That's 27, sir.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
23   CONTINUED:
34   CONTINUED:
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
215  CONTINUED:
48   CONTINUED:
184  CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
How long have you been up north?
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Thanks.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll go into town with you.
Was there any trouble?
Be careful, okay?
You're hurt.
Leave it here.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Does he have people?
Surviving is what I know --
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Can you walk?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
If Corbett's men find out --
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
What is it you want? What?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
What needs clearing up?
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Hi.
I was going to do that for you.
Hey -- you let him...
Stop asking everyone.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
I'll never forget you said it.
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
What do you want?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Was this supposed to be your room?
No!!!
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
But what about...
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
You changed the room around...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
How's Verdell doing?
She's nice.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Good evening.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Absolutely.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
No, I didn't.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Go away.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
What's wrong?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Why?  What happened?
Bain.  Michael Bain.
What are you doing?
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
Deadline?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Nikita?
An assassin?
What does that mean?
Why?
How?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
With computers.
I killed him.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Not even a stalemate?
How was the beach?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I don't believe that.
Was that it?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
No?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Because, I'll take it.
Why?  I don't know.
Who was she?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
I waited another four minutes.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
How much farther?
I think I've heard of you.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Yeah.
This will take some time.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
But we are underground?
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Like Custer huh?
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
And put it on expenses?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Yep, except a name for this place.
I'm an idiot?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Afternoon!
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
And a tram hit you?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Yeah, somewhere?
It's...42 56 76 .
Doug, I can't just leave you!
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
There shooting at something.
Good morning.
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
But we could go to London and live in England.
I don't understand, it's your home?
About forty minutes.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Will they free me?
Will this thing take long?
You mean it's started?
I thought I'd help out.
Shall I wash these out?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
And you broke into that room?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Sure!
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You are responsible...What has happened?
Have you lost all control of this city?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
So go dance.
She's coming over here...
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
You look nice. I should have dressed.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Deranged.
You.
Yeah.
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Because I try to be nice to people?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Looking for intelligent life?
People can see.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
What does that mean?!
Hey.
She great or what?
Your turn.
I don't understand...
Ergo?
Nope.
Can I -- go out?
Will you do something for me?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
So talk to us about something.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Morning Dick.
It's polyester.
Hi, Marty!
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Fine..
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
Who, me?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
March 11th.
Eight thirty.
Catch you later! 
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Pardon me?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Where did you get this?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
There's no way of knowing.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!  
Pretty, isn't it?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What do you feed him?
Does he bite?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Well, Kit...
Hi.
What for?
No, you're not either.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
You still in school?
Doing what?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Why not?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Don't call me stupid.
I came in the front.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Look at all this junk.
You tired?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Don't.
Have you got a better idea?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
What's that?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
You didn't walk out here.
Hi.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
What?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
You okay?
Apache?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny!  Look!
Got a casualty list?
Raise your hand...where?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What's his problem?
Pick those up, Reno.
Pictures don't lie.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...Got a sweetheart?
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
How did you know about that?
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Hold on –
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
It's more than I've got.
You'll be back?
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I – Mr. Lipnik –
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Transient or resident?
L.A.P.D.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Yeah, I was drinking.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
How's not smoking?
What are you doing here?
We were in some of the same classes.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
Who?
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Why did you change your name?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Was there anyone with you last night?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
Because you didn't love him --
Sure.
I'm tired.
How exactly did you hear?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
When did you write it?
How's your shoulder?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
What do we do now, Nick?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
It teaches you to lie.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
What's goin' down, son?
You think I --
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
Homicide.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Is this finished yet?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
What's with the wigs?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Is Jean Michel here?
How much for these five?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
What do you mean?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
I'm not black.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
– In this corner?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Who am I?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
She's good.
What's wrong with me?
What's that?
I really... admire you.
What? What do you want?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
You don't have any!!!
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I guess this mean we won.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
We've met.
Didn't I say that?
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
... eight, seven...
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Working late?  I'm touched.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
You certainly will not.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
I love you, old man.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
How did you...?
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
Winded, old timer?
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
And?
You're not even listening to me.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
You will rescue my wife
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Maybe they're right.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
...A bat.
What do maniacs always want?
Letters in the alphabet.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Rinka.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
To kill me.
That kid is amazing.
He sure did.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Find anything interesting?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Chase?
I'll show you it works.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How'd you find us?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Go ahead. You can say it.
A-14.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
GET IN THE CAR!!
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
... How long have I been out?
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Do you sail?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Got it!
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
You are on drugs.
Are they paying you for all this?
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
HOLY SHIT!!
Yeeees?
And what did you say?
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Hi,
Everything's gonna be fine.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
What happened?!!!
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
It is urgent, sir.
Interesting suit.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
What a dork. Huh huh.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
So, like, where is she?
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Turd-burglar...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Um... ass... head...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Who sent ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
I don't think we survived the crash.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Oh, honey, we may need that.
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Here's something.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
What?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
So can I?
Wait for who?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
All right.  Who are you?
Just one daughter.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
How'd you do on the science test?
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Three syllables.
Beetle!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
What do you think, honey?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Okay?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
Is this the key to the attic?
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
... And please call me Robert.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Did you lose something?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Can you see well?
Do you like it?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Certainly, Ben.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Please, sir.
Does it have a television?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Evening, Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Since you were a child?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Correct.
... In the garden?
Sid, it's useless!
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... What do you make of all this?
Good night.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Thank you.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
Did you eat?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Why aren't you at work?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
What about Maxine?
We?
Don't forget me.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
You fell in love with her first.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
A better friend.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Mr. Juarez?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
No.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Yeah.
Somebody told you.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Two hundred dollars, please.
Impressions? Those are hard.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
The Great Mantini?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Yes, my dear?
Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Oh, be still my heart.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Yes?
How do we do that?
What's the play?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Darling!
Come on in.
I'd love to see your work.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Captain Mertin?
Well?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
WILL YOU STAY?
You don't sit with me!!
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Well, if you want my opinion...
What you want?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Be here. In case.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
Won't you be late for work?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
You?
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
Sethe?
No, You looking good.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What? What? You talking back to me?
Hey!!
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Her life is in your hands.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Can we just rent it from you?
Sir, please lower your voice--
Yeah.
Almost five!
I am the Walrus.
Burkhalter.
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
No, they--
Heh-heh--
Yes, heh--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
No.  Here.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Oh yeah?
Oh, no.
Yeah, but my-
Well--sure, I could do that--
A hundred.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Jeffrey.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
...Huh?
Wooden bridge, huh?
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
That wasn't her toe.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
No.
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
This driveway.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Dude here.
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Dude here.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Employed?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Oh, shit.
Shit, sorry man.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.
Thank you.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Why do you hate us so much?
You came back for me.
Where were you, Whistler?
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
And why is that?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
What took you so long?
No longer.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
How did you know?
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
What am I injecting you with?
You care about him, don't you?
Are you all right?
It won't work on you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
What's she look like?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--<u>myth</u>--
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Baby names?
You want me to scooch over next to you?
I think we get the gist.
What can I get you?
Just now?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Are you marked like this??
--hours before--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't know yet.
Can't you like just divine it?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
Nice tent.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Me, too.
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Nobody's going anywhere--
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Cotter--
What're you doing?
What?
Okay, but--
<u>What</u>?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
403 41st Street, kids: home.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What?
--bullshit--
Okay. Hypothetically.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Thanks, Meurice.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
What was that?
...Drive me to a motel?
On the phone. Was it for you?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well I'll be damned.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Ray?... What time is it?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...You called me this morning.
Well... what happened?
...Who?
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
So how long have you know Meurice?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
What did you take these for?
Now that don't make much sense.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Well what?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...What?
Dead, huh?
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
What's this?
That's not the point.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Howdy stranger.
Is Marty here?
...Why?
What day is it today, Angie?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Anything you can tell me?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Is Sandy part of this?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Not yet.
Hello, baby.
. MOMMY!.
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
He's comin' back?. What for?
Yes? What is it?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Look.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes.
It used to make me laugh .but.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
Are you a bad boy?
Shut up.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm glad you do.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
Shh. I'll tell you.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks.
Hey? . You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Brilliant.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
O.K.
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
Who, me? Why should it?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
NO.
You want to dance?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
... Sandy?.
How ya doin' Dad?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What?
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Que va hacer?
Blanca, por favor.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Mirtha.
And I only deal with you?
What did I tell you?
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
What's that?
What kind of project?
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Diego Delgado, please?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
George.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
In how long?  A week?
Mexico.
Barbara.
G-d, son.
Layaway shmayaway.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
Yeah, maybe.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I know.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
How are you doing, George?
George.
Figured it out.
Source?  What about Derek?
No, that's alright.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
What do you want from me?
There's schools in California.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
For instance, something like this?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Stoned?
Yeah?
So?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Of course. As soon as possible.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
No ...
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Where were we?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
How you doin' Mister D?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
What can we prove?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Objection, Your Honor.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
You've been following me?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Who found him?
Can you give the court an example?
Yes.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
High school?
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What happened next?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
That bastard!
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
Yes.
What do you have in your purse?
Do you think I did it?
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
-- And then?
Hi, Frank.
Sorry.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Alright, I'll talk to her
What are they saying?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Because I'm expecting a call.
But Your Honor--
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
I can back it up.
This is not relaxing.
Really.
Can't it wait?
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
What's she like?
She sounds like quite a woman.
It's more involved than that.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Well, that's a long time.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Eeeww!
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Lawyer here?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
What are you doing?
Then why do you?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I bet mom could've helped her.
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Nobody did.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh, that's nice.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
He's very... clean.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
What?
Why, do you think?
Do you miss it?
I'm sorry. That was...
You drink bug repellent?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No, I'm just saying --
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Take me somewhere.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Am I too heavy for you?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
What are you doing?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
No. Don't do this.
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
Franny?
Oh my God...!
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Is it true?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
You want us to move in here?
You soundin' like the old man now.
Shit.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
That's what?
Looking to score?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Let me see your hand.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Sorry, my brother.
Have you ever been inside?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
I can't.  Not yet.
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Not really to live, just to play.
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
Oh, shit ...
So, you just got out?
Caesar, I'm leaving.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
Violet, please!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
He didn't see you, did he?
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
I need you ...
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
What are you doing?
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Now that's teamwork.
Caesar, don't.
How many'd you do?
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Cease, can I ask you something?
See?  We're for real.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
A beer?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
I wanted to apologize.
He's a launderer?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
There is no going back.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Done.  We go now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
And what if I couldn't do that?
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
I'm going to Paris.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
So now you know.
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Keep it. 
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
You have your passport?
Sir, you waited on line.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Was it the break-in?
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Jesus...
So what's in Paris?
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
What does that mean?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Where?
I should go.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
Get in the basement.
xxxxxx...
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
-- what're you talking about? --
What if it doesn't come back?
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
...Be back.
... And then some.
I think we'd better have a look.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
If I can help you ...
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam!
Hello, Jack!
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
So what are you going to do about her?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Say it was a mistake.
Jack, she's innocent!
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Stamped?
Are you alright?
Who are you? Let go!
Don't litter my cab!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Why not?
It's heavy.
No, really.
Turn around!
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
I was right! Step on it!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
I'm going to open it!
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Try next of kin.
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
Hey - that's my desk!
Lime, I need to use your computer
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
My I.D. cards.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I don't know which numero.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Now look what you've done to him.
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
You know each other a long time?
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
He's dead, huh?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Yes?
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
I think I'd remember that.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
Who is it?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He got better.
The family know?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Last show of the night.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Turn it off.
Mr. Oh.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Stomach again.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
Okay.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Eventually rising to...
Which would you prefer?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Watch? --
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Do you feel good about it?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I think you're the Devil.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
So who's the guy?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Do it then.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
But thanks.
What did he say?
How do I get out of here?
Yes.  That's right.
What?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
...good-bye then.
What?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
One year...almost one year.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Nervous?
Jane?
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
So what did you think?
You okay?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
Okay.  Good night.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Why?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Where's the bathroom?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Not even a little bit?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
You really like it?
What's it called?
Look at the size of it!
Let's see it.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Oh yeah?
More champagne, your majesty?
Did you hear what he said?
Goodbye.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter...there's...
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Are you trying to be funny?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Man look at that get up !
What did he say?
Where'd ya buy that?
Yeah.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Go home.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You know what that proves?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
Police officer.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I saw your...cat.
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
T-tell him that?
Nice game.
No, we didn't.
It's coffee.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I'm fine.
Which way did she go?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hi, Buffy.
Buffy, honey?
What's Bobby gonna say?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
You're even weaker than the others.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Is that your car?
You want some water or something?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Well, stay here tonight.
Why'd you come back?
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I'm going out the front.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I was a slave.
Wait a minute.
Meet me at this address after school.
Why do you keep saying that?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Oh.  Sorry.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
I'm curious, is all.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Come one, that was so weird.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
What... are you?
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Why?  Why me?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
Omniplex?
Buffy!
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
Smell of booze much.
Except for Prom.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Just till I lose.
No.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Fundamentals?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
He did?
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
She's dancing with me.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
See my hips?
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Don't tell anybody.
Damn.
I doubt that.
Why baseball?
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
I got released.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
He did know.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
What do I got?
Party without me.
What do I gotta do?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
What's wrong?
Settle what?
No.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
No way.
Who you calling a "boy"?
I gotta go now, Dad.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
It's a miracle.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
What'you want, kid?
Ain't here.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Well, I'd rather not say.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Look at yours.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
A powerful man.
He even played golf with the President.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
...stupid things.
...been right, but who knows?
No, you're not calm.
Hey!
Okay.
She's not here, Sam.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Ohh!
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
My wife?
Listen, I would -
That's right, yeah.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
...hundred yards further down the road.
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
No problem.  Sorry.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Oh, it's so soft.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
You can't make me stop caring...
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...under?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
Get off of me! Stop it!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You threw it away?
I put her to bed.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Hi, Sam.
Get - Get up! Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Yeah, okay.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I just wanna get out of here.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
What expenses?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Yes.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
He won't let me in my own house!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Can I go in?
And here. Here.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
All right. Okay, okay.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
And I mean... that's no good.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
What? What?
Hm.
Nicky, please...
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Great.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Well, how 'bout that?
I'm here.
Do you know that?
...all the luck in the world.
I just talked to him.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Wow.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
You walk past me?
This is Nick.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I know. I know.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Tony.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
I'm positive.
You're a little confused?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Since when do you talk like that?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I know, but that's enough.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
What's the matter...
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I better go report this in...
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What a "drag."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
I loved you.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
You think so?...Selina?
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
Hello, Spooky.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Hey, you're anti-male.
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
I don't know what came over me.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Nothing. How's your hand?
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Maybe.
Don't sneak up on me...
Any place.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
What was that for?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
And stop with the directions.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Any minute.
Do I know you?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Lady, try making some sense.
Who smashed the phone?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Why tell me this?
You can't give up.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
God, if he doesn't come back --
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Yes sir.
It's locked.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
At least one.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Do you think they'll walk away?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Any idea where you're going?
They did some great job of reforming you.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Pass.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
It's in the process.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Stop the crying.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
What does it take to kill you?
I can see the benefit in that.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Seems not.
Why are you picking on me for?
Let me talk to the lady again.
I already called for an ambulance.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
I thought so.
Scottish?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
It takes all types.
What you think?
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Don't be like that --
Jimmy.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Take your clothes.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Jesus Christ!
As different as it's possible to be.
What would he think?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Can't leave me now.
Even now.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Sorry, darling.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
I didn't mean to hit you.
How?
Details, baby, details.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You do something for me, Dil?
And you wouldn't leave me?
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Love me.
Then say it.
What would you do for me?
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
Promise?
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
What was it?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Leave her out of this.
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
Perfect.
Why?
Why do you want to do that for?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
She your wife?
Can't. Once I signed up.
Best game in the world.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Having two pints in the Rock.
The best.
Do you?
See if she's all right.
Help me.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
What?
And you know what?
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
All right -- where's the letter?
What are you talking about?
No -- I guess not.
What's the matter?
You don't look so bad in this light.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Ours.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Café.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Steal it how?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Yes -- ?
It's Charles!
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
But you're -- divorced?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Keep going.
Not my room!
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Does it hurt?
You can't.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Why can't you be serious?
What are you doing?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
They've got Jean-Louis!
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Why don't you shut up!
Monsieur Félix -- ?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
About how wealthy would you say?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Is it all right?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
Please, not on my account.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
What was all that?
What are you doing in here?
Who said?
What your husband was mixed up in.
What?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Who is it?
What'd he say?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Stop that!
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Do you know him?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Hi Jody.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
It's almost ten o'clock.
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Is Jody still awake?
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
We just found another body.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
You're the killed.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Oh nice save.
No!
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Especially not your dad.
You know I want to go with you.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Mom?
Did he say anything else about her?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Who?
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
What are you doing?
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Unfair?!
Stacy?

Shit!
Where do you want this stuff?
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Come on, get in the truck.
...town. 
No cell.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck! That's...
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
...fine.

    Elvis is on ice again.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
Come on, old...
...Shift.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
That's right.  Now,  move!

 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
...ho!

 Okay.  Okay. 
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Come on!


Okay.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
Listen, Arlo...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...

 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
They're takin' off.
We're gonna die!
 All right.  Okay.
Arlo!
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Oh, shit.
Here...
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Mason.
What?
...another way  outta here.    Hey.

What'd you come back for?!

Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Who put the big hurt on...
...us.

We're worried...
What'd he say?
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I urge you to be persuasive.
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?


...take my sorry old truck.
You got a prob-...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
They were all wearing hardware.
Now listen to me.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
"I am become Death, the...
No!


...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
"Went away."  I like that.

Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?

This is it.

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.

You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Shit.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Is this your establishment?
Quite a getup for jacking...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Yeah?
I want you to look at one another...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
...-tainer!

 



...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...it.
Yeah?
 Two pots of coffee...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Ah.
Great.  All right...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?

Well, your prediction was on the nose.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
So you don't remember...
...public drunkenness....
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...on the other end of this phone.
  All right.

Gimme this god-...
Oh.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Sir?
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
At my age, you tend to lose track...
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
Is she all right?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
Off the alley.
I'll throw that in too.
That's just lovely.
The apple core?
Hello, Jake.
You've done well by yourself.
Looking for someone.
Or her name?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
A complete surprise?
Iced tea.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
No. I went riding rather early.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
I got your check in the mall.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
I mean I can't tell you.
For very long?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Over the water department, or over you?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
When was the last time?
As little as possible.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
...No. Why was it.
What's wrong?
Where?
And I want to know where.
Okay, give me the keys.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Going somewhere?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Sophie.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
That's a long fall.
The L.A. River?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
They were partners.
What about?
Yeah?
Neither do I.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
How's school?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Father, I have sinned...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
My husband...you know him.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
Then where's the money?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
How long's it been shut?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Who else you been to see?
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
But, Mr. Kane -
Is it good?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
Almost two to one -
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Emily, you -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Oh!
A rooster?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I mean in New York.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
You goin', Mom?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
Tired?
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Yes?
Why not?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
All right.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Who told you you could sit down here?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
Are you sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
I think you'd better leave now.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Can I use the bathroom?
Why aren't there any lights?
He was?
I was here the whole time.
It's not what you think.
Well... kind of, sort of?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Look how full of yourself you are.
Sang.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Then who operated the store?
With this guy locked in?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Who are you to make assessments?
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Pack of cigarettes.
Cute cat. What's his name.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What time do you have to stay till?
She called me.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
The Emperor.
So they build another Death Star, right?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
What's he looking for?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Which ones?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Design major.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
You know.
Let me borrow your car.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
What's that for?
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
What the fuck did you do that for?
What?
I didn't think they even enforced this.
What did she say?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Who eats cock?
Around three or something.
Thirty-seven.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Make them change.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
You didn't have to choke me.
Like ten after.
To say the least.
Are you open?
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
You know him?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
What?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You're kidding.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
What were you doing up so late?
What? What is that?
You're trusting.
Ooh! Can we?!
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
What the hell was that for?
What do you mean?
He requested this?
Yeah, right.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Well...?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
I feel sick.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
What the fuck did you do that for?
A couple...?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
What part of Russia?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
And... he told you all of this?
I will. Take it easy.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Surprise me.
You know how the airlines are.
Go on, fetch.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
There you go.
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Hello, Gabriel.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Never, what?!
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
What's he doing?
Murdering, motherfucker...
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Go after her.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
What the hell are you doing--
Don't use my name!
Don't give him anything.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Help you.
Fine, sir, fine.
What would you like to know, sir?
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Who said that?
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Surprise?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
What do I want?
I'm gonna be sick.
Crime?
Yes, sir.
Blue eyes?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Just part of hospital routine.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
How many did I get right?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
D'you think we should do something?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
You know Dmitri?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
What?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
What if they're wrong?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
I'm in town for a short time.
I got caught up at work.
I'm standing right here.
You're kidding me.
Yeah?  So?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...why is everything always about you...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I think he's dead.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
What?
How about the thingy next to it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Get rid of 'em.
I can't believe this.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Max?  What are you doing?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Show up for <u>what?</u>
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Gimme your wallet.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Max?
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I never told her.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You okay?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Shoot.
That was him.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Now what?
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Blue moon...
Blue moon...
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
What's that?
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
Excuse me?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Night after that?
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
I disagree.
You know why I'm here.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
David --
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
You...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Dr. Cullers?
There is no direct evidence, no.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
So who...?
So we passed some kind of test?
It's time to go home now.
Some kind of circuitry...?
What's that?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Why don't you come back with me?
I'd say this is slightly different.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
The V.L.A.?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Someone tell me this is really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Champagne please.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
Spoken like a true believer.
I flinched.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Did you love him?
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Ellie --
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
What went wrong?
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Tell us about it.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Whatcha got?
Lemme see it!
Somebody say somethin'?
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
What you mean, Luke?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
I'm in.
Back a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
Stop that.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
It's good medicine.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
I thought he was lying.
When he was seventeen.
Who are you?
The door was already open...
She's supposed to have it.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How do you know that?
We'll show that to...
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Is that it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
What's that siren?
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
Maybe you should...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
It's a woman shot in a car?
They all have one...
Open the door.  Please.
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
I was.
Michael Johnson.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
What's wrong with him?
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Sergeant?
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
What the hell you need her for?
How'd you get in on the deal?
I just got here myself, Susan.
He's not treating her right...
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
There, that's better.
What!? They brought the car here?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Are we allowed to park here?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
Maybe.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Yes.
Which flowers did you order?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Yeah?
It had this red spot on its back.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
A while, I guess.
What have you done with the ring?
For a price.
No.
Shocking, huh?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I have a terrible confession.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I love the pillows.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Something like that.
What?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I sure know what that feels like.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
I guess I should go now.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
I don't think so.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
You what?
Who?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Who?
No.
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
But you were there?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
I don't know.
For what?
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Get that, will you?
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
It's not?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
What?
I've got a way with people.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
What hotel?
They don't have a wine list.
No, I didn't.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
I'll drive.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
You guys used to work together?
No.   It's mine.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
No shit?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
And how do we do that?
Did she break your heart?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Go ahead.
Why do you want to teach me?
You're already a thief.
Hello.  What is your name?
Please sit.
I'm tired now.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
I've missed you.
Please.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Here you must be in proper attire.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Let's end this here.
Give it back!
Let's stop a moment.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Then, why did you come?
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
You buying?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
Mom --?
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
What's goin' on, Elly?
Well, how's your friend?
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
I wish to possess what you have now.
How the hell did you do that?
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
That thing is poisonous.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I'm Kathryn.
You heard me.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
How do you know I've been with several women?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Need a lift?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
What are you reading?
Sure. Have a good night.
Need any company?
I don't.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Good for you.
Please don't go.
Why aren't you understanding?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Ben Schwarz.
What do you mean?
Are you shitting me?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Outstanding.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
What are you saying?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
What do you mean?!
Does your mother know?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
Excellent.
What are you doing?
I look terrible.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Want to join me?
Need any company?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Positive.
Is she with you?
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
Hello.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
I don't find this very funny,
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Why not?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Moving along quite well.
Any day now.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
You amaze me.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Shut up.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
No, tell me.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Some other time.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I thought we should celebrate.
Well done.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
You're too kind.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
You get your wish!
Did you ever make a wish?
The Farren house
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
She was very pretty.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Something's haywire,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
It's your play.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
What's funny?
That's the Farren house.
Did you mail then?
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
No, I didn't.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Who are you?
Will you be friend for always?
Can't you get it, darling?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
Hurry!
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Mother! You called me by name!
Let the child stay.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Waiter! She needs more water.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
How have you been feeling?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Do you really need these?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
Are those Mark's?
I wonder if he's married.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
DON'T call the police.
You expecting someone?
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
You're such a good friend.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Fall in love.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
What?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
Coffee and...
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
You wanna get some coffee?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Yeah. Maybe.
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Except Mark of course.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
Is it that funny?
You didn't say it.
Your breasts feel larger.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
How do you know?
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Here's a towel.
We can get a warrant if you like.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You want her sheets?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
You think mafia hit?
What kind of animal?
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
How long have you been here?
His wife.
They don't speak English...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Please, they'll kill me...
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
People...  after me.
I don't know who they are.
What now?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
I didn't realise...
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
What does she say?  The woman.
Known me for long?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
Why?
What are you hiding?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
How much do you usually get paid?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
For a month.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Nightmare...
Just don't call him, Alan!
I don't give a shit.
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
A condition...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
Three years.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
What do you mean by that?
Are you threatening me?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Will he be alright?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Thanks, I wrote it.
Dave...
Fine.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Something like what...
The Fidelity nonsense...
... Sometimes they do.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You ever use it?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Who?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
What?
You're leaving?
Where are you going?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
What?
I know. I'm sorry...
I never thought I'd...
The Monroe?
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
Sir. It's quite clear that...
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Curse?
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
What?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
What?
He is dying. He knows it.
Dios mia.
NOOOOOOOOO!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Mary.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
It's been fired.
Sounds boring to me.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Oh God, it's over now!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Don't stop.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Charlie...
Nuwanda, what is going on?
What happened?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Well, sure!
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Very good, Mr._?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
LOUDER!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Too bad.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
What is it then?
So?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Oh..
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Put more into it!
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
And no questions asked.
Not an option.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You don't have to be so touchy.
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Shut up! You hear me!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Man, don't go up there...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
I mean...where is everbody?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
That's mustard!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
Nick's going?
Here's to huntin'.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
See, I'm going home.
You are his friend.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Where's it gone?
Rough, huh?
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda, what's the matter?
Okay.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
What are you doing?
Playing?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
What'd he say?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Great. That's great.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Great. Hey. That's great.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Did you go hunting.
You didn't get a deer?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
It's Merle, Sal.
Yeah.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
What the hell's that for?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
The fuck I did!!!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Speak up.
I'm not on the force anymore.
What's this?
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
I'm wasting time.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir---
I have to go home, Sanchez.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Hey, buddy...
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Married?
Yeah.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
How do I look?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
But he was such a good cop.
Seat's too high.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
Jabez -- ?
Belle --
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Mama!
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Grandma, look at me!
What do you want?
Afraid ... of what?
Where did it come from?
No, no! Give it to me!
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You know darn well it is.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
I'll get the doctor.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
My son ... what's the matter?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Me?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
You're very perceptive.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Hans, he killed by brother --
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Bad for your health anyway.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Encourage them to be bolder.
I...have a request.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
...I've missed you.						*
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
It looks like a whole roast.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
How are you doing?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
So... that sure is something.
What are you talking about?
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah.
I don't have a choice.
Yeah... yeah!
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
We're all set at Kennedy.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
The gun's right on your back...
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
What if I take you with me?
Where's the air conditioning?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
No you don't.
Yeah.
What is it, Sam?
Thanks again, Sam.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Did you always call him Junior.
Because I don't want cancer.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Ah, Jesus...
He wants one.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...

Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Okay - you got your one.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh - Maria!
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
We can't stay here.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Did Pop come down?
Of course not ...
This is Drake Bishop.
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Morning.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Is that the decoder?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Really? Did you play in a band?
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.

This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Talk to me.
What did he do this time?
So?
You the man.
No, you the man.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
This might take some time.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's a fucking shame.
Let it be broke.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Can you pay me now?
Whatdafuck do you want?
We both do.
Hot.  Hot.
Tina, you are too slick.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
You a blue-moon fool.
Why you gotta curse?
It's cold.
Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Shaddup, Vito.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
You deaf or what?
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
I didn't know you could read.
That's what you think?
I'll do that.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I'm listening.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
I know this.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.
You really think so?
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
You're it.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Hi.
Excuse me.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
HARRY!
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
What?
What are you wearing?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
What?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Your mom made a move on me.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Collins is a great man!
I didn't know that.
Nice jugs.
You're it.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
What?
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Sure I do. On one condition.
I don't think so.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Captain Rob came back?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
George Washington!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Hey, it's Jessica.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Well, I'm listening now.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
But my mom gave me the map.
What? What did we do?
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
The one on the left.
What?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
You had some questions.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
What are you doing here?
What?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
That's my boyfriend.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Okay.
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Obviously.
I think you did it.
God, I've missed you.
Oh, just like the President.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
My thanks.
What happens now?
What's that you're saying?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Remove her gag!
Run!
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Man-carved steps.
The Water of Life.
The Voice again.
It burns.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Did they try and fail?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Bela, what happened?!
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
What is this place?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Goddamn, it's cold!
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Wow.
H-how'd you know?!
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Goddamn landlord.
You're a fuckin' mess.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
I kinda need it now.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
I think you're quite handsome.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Lugosi?
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
What are you making?
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
You look beat.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Stop!
What was that?
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
You thought it was me?
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You know what would be great?
What did you study?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yeah?
Ed --
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.

I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Al!
You said that.
You know who we are?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Hey, he cheated on her.
How's Marcia? She all right?
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Who?
Who?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi, Mom. 
What are you doing?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Why do it?
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Oh God, this is so weird.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
So...?
There's a list.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
I need to talk.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Polish acrobat.
Marcia's living with a singer?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
I was in jail.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
That girl's an idiot.
Can I help with anything?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
What does that have to do with... ?
Tu
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
I want you to do something for me.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
What a surprise.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Hmm?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Which door?
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Shall we give it a name?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Right now?
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Where 're you going?
She's doing this to get back at me
I mean at you.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yes, Paul?
What do you want?
How's the left these days?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
I want to know about Exley.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Bud...
Richard Stensland.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Should I?
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Where are the police academy files?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
No.
No.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
<u>No</u>.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
It's a simple question.
So what's the point?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
Decorated?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm curious about you.
How was I?
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
Shut up!
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
What do you think?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Gimme that.
You're driving.
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
Same thing?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
Pretty fast.
What are you dialing?
Feeling lucky?
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
What size?
That's my point.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
You tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
For your wife?
Hey.
What?
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Bobby?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
He's got his priorities?
Stacy?
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Oh, please--
I know.
Is Eric in school?
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
The lingerie.
I was missing you.
Are you sure you're safe?
Who?
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
I know.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
You're a moron, you know that?
He didn't.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Listen--
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
He's kidding.
Who won the fight?
Yeah.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
No, but they took my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
He's heard that it's escalated.
You gotta--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Turn yourself in.
Tell me about it.
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
We'd have to--
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
No thank you.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
You felt obliged to.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What am I looking at?
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Will you please come in?
What do you hate most?
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Shall we be all right?
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
A broken car?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Very well.
Have you seen Katharine?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
How are you?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
What if I told you he did this to me?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Well, then ask him his name!
Hello.
Oh, all over.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Why do you think?  About my staying?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I have a cigarette?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's Canadian.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Why would anyone do this?
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Will you come with me?
And what if he really is a spy?
Hello.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
You've got a mustache.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Don't overestimate yourself.
I have a question...
Why are we speaking Chinese?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
You have a car?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
The Empress Death Mask.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
But Roki said--
Those are my clothes.
Lose something?
Only a week?
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Someone was expecting that.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Why don't we take oxygen?
I didn't mean to get personal.
Thank you.
To us. To the Mask.
Aren't we all.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
One, two, three...
You can't be too careful.
Can you see the other PIRs?
The big job.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
What's that?
Peoples China Bank.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You can't be serious.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Four billion dollars.
That's because you grew up rich.
The sign of our partnership.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
This is just show and tell.
You'll just have to have faith.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Tony Marvin.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What the hell is this doing here?
What's she doing here?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
I don't even know how much money that is.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Oh, yeah?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
I like this case.
Whoa.  No shit.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
What's a demur?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
I wasn't gonna --
When'd they file the demur?
Who's the judge?
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Ross.
What kind of chromium is it?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Yeah.  A real moron.
You've been reading for hours.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Can I play roller hockey?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Cause I don't even know you.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
You are someone.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
About this.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
And I miss you.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
It'll be fine, yeah.
What?
Wow, that's soon --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
My lord.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Howls.
Well, it's been awhile.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks at Han.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks his consternation.
... Like we're being watched.
Give me that!
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Yes sir!
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
What are you so grouchy about?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
That was no earthquake.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
I don't like this.
What are you staring at?
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Are you kidding?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
What's going on?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
You rest now.
A tremor!
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Jabba the Hutt?
Leia!
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
That they are.
But tell me why ...
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Yes, My Lord.
It won't get through the blockade.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Give it to me.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Getting ready to invade.
Stop the damn car.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Is that what I think it is?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
At last...
Perceval, you have returned!
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
At your service, sir.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
But, I'm here.
Father...
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
Me?
Why didn't he kill us?
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
They do.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
I'm sorry.
Hi
Here.
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
It's serious?
Would you like some more coffee?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Oh, she'd love it.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
No. No rats.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Pretty close?
Did he tell you about my party?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
You wouldn't.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Did you know my mother died recently?
Is she gonna die?
What kind of stuff?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Hey, where'd this come from?
Where?
Oh I bet he is.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Well your thinking's not so good.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Hi Chris. Great party.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
Goodnight Dims.
She seemed fine.
Do you like films?
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Did you do that?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
...look down in pity...
Miss?
Yes
Trunks?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Beasley.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
My brother and I. One each.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
That's not the point.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
You look awful.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
This time you gotta go.
Your older brother.
What're you talking about?
Jack.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
What's that?
You're getting cold feet about this.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Just a lucky guess.
Day.  Wednesday.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
How dare you say you love me.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
Expensive hangover.
Couple years.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
What?
What's it for?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
You weren't there.
Yeah, fine.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Actually, that's my stage name.
What do you mean?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
When?
What's the problem?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
That!  You can't wear that!
They're tight.
Oh, thanks.
Maybe it's legit.
You play all these places?
Hey, we're connected.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Hey, will you look at that?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Huh?
Some discussion.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
How do you do it? Every night?
You were good.
You were good.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Yeah.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Big piece or little?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
Perfect fit.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
So?
What do you mean?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
... I was dreaming ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
How is he?
How's Loomis?
Which ear was it?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What are you going to do!
Stay away from my family!
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Jamie ...
Clarissa left those here.
When did you start smoking?
Kim?
Castor's escaped!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You merciless bastard!
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
What about me?
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
... That's great.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
What are you doing?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Jack, are you okay?
We’re almost done here...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Where do I go now?
Maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
What are you doing?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Damn...
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Got a minute, Jack?
Yes you do...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Miss me, Jack?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
Finger food...?
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
Something like that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
I can't seem to let go of you...
What kind of man does that!?
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
How can you do that?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
Well...Annie for one.
Our life in a nutshell...
How was the game, honey?
You mean this chocolate cake?
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
What’s going on?
Peter Lassiter...
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
No...I’m not...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I had it at four.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
We had a tough year.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
Ben?
About me?  How sweet.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
And where do we think we're going?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can...make it work.
What's going on?
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Wish I knew why.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Just one, General...
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
A surgeon might...
No need to get up --
We can't take a second more.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
How does it look, Doctor?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
You said there was a quick way out!
A what?
There it is!
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
I don't believe that.
I can't tell you.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Can I see your license and registration please?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Yah.
Where you girls from?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Yah.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, but -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, how much money was that?
Twice.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Better times.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Yah?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Gustafson's accountant.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Hon?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
They announced it?
...So?
It's just the three cent.
And his wife?
This is do-able.
What... ?
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Cornelius!  How are you?
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I'll take the parasites.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
I'm just on my way out...
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Make sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
When?
I don't know.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is that what you're calling it?
I'm sorry, I...
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
What?
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
What happened... ?
You were in here last Thursday night.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Well, uh... great.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Yeah.
A nice, big cock.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Go ahead.  Say it.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
Unbelievable, huh?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
What are we doing?
I asked you what you studied.
Hey.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
I want to hear the truth.
This conversation...
"Too young?"
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Fuck you.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
Tyler...
Ask me nicely.
One minute.
NO...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Did you hear what I just said?!
Animals.
Would you rather be dead?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
You've made your point.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Take a guess.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Kalarjian?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Mom?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
It's only the end of June.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
That's why I was there last night.
"It?"
This place?!
That... him?
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
It broke!
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Ever do this from a jet?
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Yeah.  Why not?
You read me, Brewer?
You okay?
I've seen worse places.
We'll check it out.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Gawd, you look awful.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
How do we get upriver?
Why's that?
Where did you find this clown?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
What's the job?
Where?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
What's up?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Let's do it.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
My parents were divorced.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Most men are.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Can I have my desk please.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What are you two up to?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
How un-sixties of you.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Now what?
Oh, Lydia!
<u>What</u>?!
... Do you know who I am?
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Why did you do that?
Will you shut-up!!!
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
How do you know him?
Well, it's enough for me.
Excuse me...
No.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I did, didn' I, El?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I'm going on over there...
I'm sorry.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
What?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Just finish eating.
How far are you going to?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Can I get you anything else?
No substitutions.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
Like what?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You were going without saying goodbye?
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Nothing.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
Is that funny?
You had no inner feeling?
Wait...
No, it isn't what I think.
I don't find your language that charming.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Robert, I think you better just...
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
And what about love?
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Mass production is what does it.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Yo.
Whadja wanna see me about?
So you got a girl?
So what's her name?
That's it?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Wussup?
Fa what?
Wha'?
What are you going that way for?
Where you goin'?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I think by Twenty-two.
Like this?
You here to see somebody?
How do I know you're not lying.
Probably.  One of the many.
No.
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Maybe tonight?
Wonder who his supplier is.
I wasn't asking.
Fletch!
What? What are you talking about?
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
So where do you know Alan from?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Two bs?
That's two.
No children?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Right.
Margaret.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
You gonna nail the chief?
You find the source?
Oh my God!
Here you are, Doctor.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Right.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Ten days ago?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Why are they after you?
Because we can't.
Alan Stanwyk.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Yo!
My hero.
His bride. Cute as a button.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Hi.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
You were in the war?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Good point.
What about his parents?
Thanks for the great time.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
Don't worry, I can take it.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I would, actually.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Your call is come through.
The door was unlocked.
I commend him on his choice.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
So let's go! We run the pictures.
How gray?
Gummy and two cops...
Yes?
You don't know the Underhills?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
So many assholes, so few bullets.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I don't know, what was the case?
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Hello?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
This is boring, guys.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Ick.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
I'm sorry...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
'Booty Time.'
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
The point?
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Jazz, we're talking here.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Got a wife named Angie.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
I don't...
What?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Allo... Salvatore...
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
There'll be someone else.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Des Moines.
When ya go back on?
Never trust a nigger.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Timezit?
Hey, Bo.
It was a crematorium.
No, I don't.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Butch called.
He did.
I'm off.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
No, I don't.
About what?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Okay, start pedaling.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
What?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
You just burned the desk.
How could this be happening?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
No, not yet.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Yeah, it's me.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Whatta you mean...
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
John, you still there?
You all right?
What?
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
I better give you my address then.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
What?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
So how'd you like LION KING?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Nah, just working the job.
Huh.
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
You're all just jealous.
Breakfast?
Why don't we go take a swim?
What're you doing?
How about a roll in the hay?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
What's the matter?!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Which one is it?
A hammock?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
And, what about us?
You know him?
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Never should've let her play.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Lake Forest Green?
So what happened?
Where'd you get this?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Eight times.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Look --
Look, I don't want your money!
Everything going okay?
I gotta get back to work.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Why did you want her body?
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
It was a community service.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh, my dear God...
I know what it sounds like.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
No thanks.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Tell me.
Where's the radio?
What's that?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I demand to know what is going on...
What a beautiful day.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
We must abandon.
Say it again.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
It's just a review.
He carries a gun.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
How do you Eknow.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Opening night, Lillian.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
And you've been extremely patient.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
This could be it!
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
How come you got the kid with you?
You're a family man, Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Because life is good.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
Why?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes, Peter.
Yes.
Yes.
And he has finer moments now and then.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
He wears a disguise.
Do you think he can do it?
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
What'd he say?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
What can we do?
And Jinnah?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
It's beautiful.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Do you find me stubborn?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Who is that young man?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
They're sparing no one, I see.
The fools!  Sorry...
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Assuming we are in agreement?
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Hello.
Good to see you're feeling better.
It's about the Director.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
What's wrong with it?
German.
What about this?
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
A day or so.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Where are you taking her?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
What do you think?
Not that.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Of course I think about it every day.
So you didn't do it after all.
I can't.
What happened?
A year is a long time.
What are you doing?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The name?  For the certificate.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Feel good?
Just like old times?
How does it taste?
How's Estelle?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I'll be okay.
Why are you laughing?
I didn't. I just waited.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I'll bet you can.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
There may be a hunting party.
That would be the first time.
You can't trust anything these days.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
Are you hungry?
No scars?
I want to say something.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Can we make it?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I don't know.
Come on, come on.
How long before this car's hot?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Yeah. I got out.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
What do you have in mind?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
A couple of weeks back.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
I made a mistake.
That's not good enough.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Can I go now?
What about?
Though nicer than most?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
And what was that?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Was it Albert?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Now tell me the truth.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Did they give you a rough time?
I won't be using the room tonight.
I'm staying with a friend.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What is it?
You don't look it.
Now just a minute...
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
What's it to you anyway?
Jack! I didn't like that.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Nasty way to go.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
What's that? A hundred?
What's that?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
They did.
I, I...I...
No.  That's absolutely right.
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
He's doing very well.
Just the act.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
They have...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
What could somebody get for them?
How do you know he'd buy them?
No.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Me?
They're going to come to everyone.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
Me?
In the abstract...
Why?
Do you need five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Fine.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Clear...
I am?
The cops?
They aren't?
Will you excuse...
Will you excuse us please?
Did they...?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
The people downtown said...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Mr. Levene...?
Would you come in here, please?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Why?
Then put me on the board.
What are we going to say?
Can't do it.
No.
Why?
That's alright.
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Mmm.
Yes.  I hear you.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
Abso...
The check's no good?
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Eight units?
Shelly...!
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
Oh, Christ.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Home...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Rick...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What's going on here?
What...?  Say the words.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
What are the police doing?
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They got, listen to me...
They took some of the con...
Where are you going?
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
We had a slight burglary last night.
Did you like your party?
Will you take me?
Why do you have to go?
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Goddamn bitch.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
Within the compound will be fine.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
What do you mean gone?
Mikey, I hoped...
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
No strings.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
Why too late?
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
Are you Klingman?
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
You're a considerate young man.
However I can help you...
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
What if I say shove it?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What makes you say that?
So what did you think?
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Is this David's doing?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Why not?
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Who's that?
Let's get out of this funk hole
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I don't know.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
I can undress myself, thank you.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Then take the pills.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Does the yardman come today?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Then the rumors are true?
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
You didn't?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
How's the leg?
What are you doing here?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
I'm just here about my brother.
Sound it out for me.
Get out --
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You have my word...
I know you.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
And this has what to do with me?
I'm on the move -
What's wrong with it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
How'd it go?
Donny --
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
What about him?
No. That was Higgins ....
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
How's it going -- ?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
What are you doing back?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
No...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Cool. So you're living up North?
Nah. It's a scratch.
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Come here --
I've missed you, man ...
Where'd you find this one?
You boost her -- ?
You okay -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
And here I am...
Hey.
You mentioned that in your letters
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Unlock your button ...
I do ... I cut "em...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Where to -- ?
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
What about me?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
What are you doing here, assface?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I'm gonna need some money.
I don't care. Something's going on.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
What about the schools?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
What happened to you?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
I hate to do dishes.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Who's she talking to?
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Stop brushin' me back!
When's the arraignment?
How's the woman?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You and Morgan throw?
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
Oh, right.
Is this a bad time?
Come on, Will...
Chuck, let's go.
You want us to give you cash right now?
How'd you like that course?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Where is it touching you?
No, there's a limit.
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Yes. Under two conditions.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Well, I'm sorry.
What are you smiling at?
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
And he mailed it to Hardy--
My kind of background?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
You moved?
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Where're you going?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
What do you want to do?
Well, she out did herself today...
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Yeah, I read those.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Yeah. Do you paint?
What does?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
I know.
I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I really don't 'date' that much.
How was that?
Yeah.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
When?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I want you to come with me.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Yeah, I'm sure.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why not?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Is that what you think--
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
That's not your affair. Name.
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two and a half cents.
Deputy sheriffs.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Been out travelin' around?
No, I never. What?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
Sure do.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Lookin' for a job?
Been doin' a job?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Get to what?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
You people got a lotta nerve.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
What's the matter, Grampa?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Anybody ask anything?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
That!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
How about it, Ma?
Was Granma bad?
Got any more, Ma?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Which ones?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Then who *do* we shoot?
How you get all this money?
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
But what about this?
Please don't.
Morning.
You don't...
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Remember high school?
Bob...
It's me. Martin Blank.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Tell me about yourself.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
...Let me get my coat.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
You kill people. 
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
How do you know?
Say more.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
What do you want?
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Is that right?
There you go. I left it blank.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Wait a minute--
You're wrong. Look at his face.
They're not happy, sir.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They were very upset.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
He sells BMW's?
What the hell happened to you?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Why not?
This is Annie MacLean.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
What?
You lived in Chicago?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Enjoy the day.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Just make yourself comfortable.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
No, you didn't.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Did he mention it?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
What are you talking about?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I'm sorry.
I should go get some of her things.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
What was I saying?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
You've already made arrangements!?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Huh-huh. You?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Was the trip okay?
Where to?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
- See, what you can do for him --...
Of course not.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Tom?
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Of course I have.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
I thought your mom's coming up?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
You want to watch some television?
Don't be such a baby!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Hey, darlin'.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
What?
Very impressive.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Ta-da!
Snoop onto them...
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
I want it to have my children!
Who's that?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Two days.
Yes!
Here's your class.
He's not in this class.
Make it our first date.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
Kate, listen.
What?
You what?
Shit!!
There they are!
I can't believe they decided you won.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
There's a new virus in the database.
Never fear. I is here.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
So what are we supposed to do?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
What is it? What's wrong?
Send a Flu-shot.
Hello, operator services.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
So?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
You think she stands a chance?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
When did this happen?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
Four plus Myers.
Now where are you going?
Yes.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
What the hell did this?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel!
What are you doing out here alone?
That's all the windows, Dad.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Hell of a night.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Get the outside shutters.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Thank you.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Jamie! Get away!
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Shit!
Look.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
I don't want to.
You idiot!
I wonder where they went.
Is that all you say?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
TOTALLY!
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Is Annie around?
Are you coming over tonight?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Can we watch the monster movies?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Laurie...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
What about the rest of my comic books?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
No...
How?
Hello.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Thorazin.
If you say so.
What did he say?
We're a big hit.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
But I'm seeing him.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Is this your first job?
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
How about you?
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Yes.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
And you're in love overnight?
She has all the cooking talent.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Why should I be afraid?
So?
How about something to eat?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Me?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
So you met somebody else?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
But you don't have any symptoms!
Yeah.  What?
Yes, please.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Ohh!
I know, I know.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Okay, okay.
Perfect!
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Good.
Oh, so loosely.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Can we, can we go?
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Thanks for a swell time.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Have you?
No, you can tell me.
Nobody ever said it.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
No, the reason I ask is--
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
You're okay, though, huh?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Well, what about me?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
When'd you get here?
Tch.
Yeah.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Uh-huh.
And?
...how are things at the Hospital?
I'm looking for...
...very good.
...why?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...aren't you afraid of me...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Who would that be.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
How you doin?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
What else did I miss...?
Hold up a minute...
Why did he come back?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
He escaped...
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
..It won't be long now, sir...
You give me whatever I want...?
...they're from Baltimore....
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
..suitcase...locker...
...unmarked hundreds....
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Waited too long, hon...?  
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Of course, Commendatore...
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling...
Who does not?
...long overdue.
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...I'm sorry....?
Indeed we were.
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...what?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
...what a lovely perfume.
...I feel that...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then tell me.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
...yes...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
...sir...?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Howdy Pouty.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Man, she's losing it...
Mine!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Fuck off.
Two billion years of evolution and                          ] you're what we've come up with--                            ] "Wichita"--the hot, cool, tell-it-                          ] like-it-is counselor with a dark                            ] side.                                                       ]
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Where did you get these?
I said I was sorry.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Shit.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
It doesn't work on small animals!
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
Did you miss him completely?
Kurt doesn't look too good.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Did to.
Your son's dead and you love him.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
You two....
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
looks startled at the outburst.
Hello!
Fruit.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
What?
Let's go overseas . . .
Just a couple more . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Bye, Dad.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
It's inside a moving car.
No.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Since what?
Must be nice.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Hello I'm Dr...
What did you just say?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Dreams?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
It's not unthinkable.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Hey, c'mon.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Oh, great.
Do you do washing machines, too?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
About what?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
And?
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Thank God.
Where'd he go?
Neil -- what --
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
And it's a shorter commute.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Did you hear that?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
Who was that?
Just reduced.
God, your sister's really hot.
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Even better.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Lieutenant?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
He had to come from somewhere.
What?
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
When did you get back?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
The river.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
To ask her to dance.
I stood up first.
How comes it your are not afraid?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
Then take me with you.
Huge.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You're hurt.
Why do you stare at me like that?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Good evening.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Where will you go now?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
We found him this morning.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Is there anything else you need?
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
You kept it?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
What will you do?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Talley.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Jen?  Are you all right?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
I have to tell you something --
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Let me come get him.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
He needs a doctor.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
What do you want?
What?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Please get away from me.
How can we get out?
Are civilians inside?
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What are you people going to do?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Where are you right now?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
He has lots of disks.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
I don't know what you're talking about.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I guess we each have something the other wants.
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Excuse me?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Who are you?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
You want to pay me?
Ten.
Give me it.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Paul, you know who this is?
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Satellites.
I will see what I can do.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
You are a marked man.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
What do you mean George?
Let’s go, Jock.
Great, I really need a shower.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
You have our cards.
How much?
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
You could have asked for a favor.
They do not have your connections.
What!
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
What are you doing?
What is this about no water?
All. What do you mean all?
Paul, are you there?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
Not yet.
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
What are you playing here, Price?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry --
Oh, really: who?
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
'Less the place really is haunted.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Uhhhh...
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
-- closed.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
You hear somebody?
Good point.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
Could we have a word?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
Sorry.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Then who did??
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Excuse me?
-- Eddie!!
Sara...?
Damn it.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
We don't have proof of that.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
What do these ingredients mean?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Help me!  Please!!!
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Are you playing tricks on me?
But do you agree with me?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
How are we doing?
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
You must be the new tenants.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
This isn't happening...
How long will it take!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
There's something through that wall!
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Hello?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
What?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Every day.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
You gonna buy?
Thank you.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Yes really.
Yes.
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Joey?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yes. 53
Yeah right.  Look ...
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
Cameras?
You got about five minutes and change.
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Now that's a lock.
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Alex, are you....
My life is not some deal.  I...
Don't you just hate kids...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
What the hell....
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
What have you been doing?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Way to go, Anna.
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Cat got his tongue?
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Something short.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hoopsucker!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
About seven minutes.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
Ol' satchel-butt...
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Cigarette?
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Well, I --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
...What happened?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...Geez.
Awwww, buddy --
...It is?
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Oh, geez.
Geez, I --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
She's good, Bennie.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
At the Houmfort.
I'd love to.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
Where were you trained?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I wish I hadn't heard --
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I suppose so.  Yes.
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You want that?
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What?
The turkey in?
Don't start.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It's a starting place.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
You've...
Well?
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
I'm fine dad.
Anyone special? You know...
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Huh?
Dad stop it!
Talking to me, dad?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
What?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Oh.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Reverend Edwards.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What do you mean?
Awesome sleet and rain.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Where you going?
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Wow!
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Yeah.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
You did your homework, Officer.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
I could say the same thing about you.
She your only sibling?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Forget your pager?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
He's asking everybody questions.
Looks like the natives are restless.
Your friend's all business.
Did you love her?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Thought I smelled something.
Hey...
I'm sorry?
Thought you might find that.
Down at the station?
What about him?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Yes.  Like that.
Where's your back-up?
Your lips, they didn't move.
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
I have not spoken to him...
I was waiting for you...
But why?
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
You didn't even warm them, did you?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
You want me to be a doll forever?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
She's no vampire.
This is no performance.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
You want death? Is it death you want?
Diane!!!!
Did I hear a yes?
Take him.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Read her thoughts.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
It's only a siren...
You followed me here, didn't you?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
How did you do that?
You can't look at them...
You loved your wife, surely.
You found nothing?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
What can I do for you?
Stupid. Stupid.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Get lost, you scared me.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
There's nothing between Will and me.
No means yes.
He does work hard.
No.
Julie...
There's no way to lock it.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Ray...what are you doing?
Checking the locks again?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
Deep breaths --
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Is there a problem here?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Well, I'm in school and --
Rio de Janeiro!
What's going on?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
He is exhausted.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
) You feel the symptoms?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
What are you doing?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
What if he is?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
This girl --
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
I have had command for the last time —-
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
Clarence . . .
Where's Mary?
A boy?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
What's that?
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
She's swell.
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
George! George!
Anything I can do back here?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Well, no younger than I was.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
George.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Where are you going?
George, can I see you for a second?
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
With coconuts?
Me?
Well, why don't you say it?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
If I told you it might not come true.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Where're you going?
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Don't!
Your dad must be really pissed.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
What is it?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Coming up!  Give way!
You coming up on him?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Tina!
What is it?  What's there?
On your own time?
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Untie that rope.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Michael.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
The what?
Do you?
Probably.
Where's my day book?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
No.
All summer?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I know you did....
I'll give notice.
What're you doing?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Did he raise the Kids?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Mmmmmm.
It'll be fun, come on!
What's wrong?
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
You're going out.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Be reasonable, please....
It hasn't adjusted.
Go on, Doctor.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Pre-opening jitters.
That macho pompous English --
Not enough loving.
Where's the rubber band?
Damn it!
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
What's wrong?
And leave me down here???
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
Michael...
You're going down there again?
After what happened to us?
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Change your mind?
Finally.
They said you'd be here.
Come on.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
Go where?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I'm sorry.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
How's sleeping beauty?
Philip.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Hi, Mike.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
How long you staying?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Herpes?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Told you you'd like it.
Take it up!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Yeah, well I didn't!
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll go with you.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
Look great, don't I?
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How'd you do in school?
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
She still talking to you?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
Come on, sweetheart....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
Like mother, like son....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
How come it's my responsibility?
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Stop that....
That....
We don't want any....
A big one....
In a minute....
I like Grandma's cooking....
Dad died from a heart attack....
I didn't mean to start that....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I want you to give up your work....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I have two right feet.
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
You sure you don't need glasses?
Hurry!
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
What happened?
Stop farting around....
You tagging them...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Hey!
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Maybe I missed you too....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Where is everybody?
What happened to Clarence and...?
When I got the grant.....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
Who?
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I'm coming...How close is it?
How come only me?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Shove it....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
How about any guys on your staff?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
How's the new residence?
There's nothing in the files?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Why?
What do you want it for?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Stop it.
Sure.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Now?
Where's your watch?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Did he get you the job?
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Me?
Did Amber have a dog?
Just your age.
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Why can't I stay with you?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
He doesn't need my help.
You do?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
What was she like?
What does that mean?
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
He's happy, darlin ..
She married some English prick.
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Well, no you didn't --
I just heard.
I have to finish my job --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Listen to me!
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Wonder what he said.
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Oh my God.
Well.
Yeah, I did.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
I don't like to give up.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Forgot your keys --
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Denver is where he should be.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
I'm asking you a question --
Why not --
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Thanks for coming.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Jerry --
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
I won't tell.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Eric!
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
What?
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
Eric! Are you here?
Well what?
You had the phone the whole time?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
How was your trip? Profitable?
You rented an automated litter box.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
They never got that big.
He used to know me.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Billy!
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
Any damage?
Is there an antidote?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Well, is he?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
What is that?
We took to the rock.
What's he got in there?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
?!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What are they?
I think she's with Sarah!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Ian.  It's guano.
So what's your story, Nick?
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Give it more morphine!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
WHAT ARE YOU-
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Phones are out too.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
The what?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Oh, shit.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - like birds - -
- - a gizzard - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie, com one!!
Do you see anything?
Alan?!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Come on, let's go.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
That's right.  Will break through.
And scary.
Unpredictability....
Alan?
Why not?
I read your book.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
Straight-A brainiac!
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Yeah, they hate me.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I didn't say you were scared.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
It's safe.
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Don't do that!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
That's not funny.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
No, but...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
What?
What happened?
Who?
Are you going to plead insanity?
Sorry.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Fascinating.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Where's he going?
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Fine -- terrible.
Will you do me a favor then?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
I usually take lunch by the River.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, sir.
Well, I --
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
Gabriela ...?
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
Do you?
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
Then that's the place for us!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
I'm sorry ...
I want to thank you.
There's a light up ahead.
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Did you see her?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
Why?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Yes?
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
What was better? I made better bait?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Who?
Gee.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
You said it was!
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Please.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
You and I -- a relationship.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Mm.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
John, how are you?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
When is mommy coming back?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
Will she pick me up after school?
What if she forgets?
Uh, huh...
Okay...Same as usual...
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
All it is is onions and gravy.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
What did you do when you were little?
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Objection!
Sustained.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
I don't recall.
I was not a failure.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Where are you going?
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
'Night, Jim.
Yeah?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
California?
She ever ask about me?
Thelma, if I die--
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
Where will you keep them?
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
With much bloodshed.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Who am I?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
I need to squeeze this brain.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Tell me.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Britain chooses not to.
America, we shall see.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
I have more men.
I want to go down there.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
I might get a shot.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
Around here.  Yeah.
I'm laying a spring trap!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
Where?  Where?
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
In Maine?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
What are you doing?
He thinks they're what?
You okay?  Kelly?
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I didn't say it like that.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
No thanks.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Well.  Goodnight.
What?
We might as well pack.
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
Hector!!
Get him onto shore.
You sure?  I don't mind...
It was... something meeting you.
Different worlds, Jack.
Are they feeding?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Thanks for your help.
This is a little different.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
You're sort of a rude person.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
They don't believe her.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Boy, is that smart...
Lecter said a lot of things.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
You're all right! Where is he?
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
What do you see, Starling?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
You seem pretty sure of that.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
No, I came because we need -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
And the questionnaire...?
Your bleeding has stopped.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Ahhh... Why?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Yes.
They all were.
Go, Doctor.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
On what basis would they reject him?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
He kills w-
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Yes... I did.
Yes, miss.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Why didn't you bury those people?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
Much further?
What is it?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Some say that's the way of it.
Will you consider that?
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
How far is it, scout?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
Who were these people?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
Will you men help us stop the French?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
What happened to you?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Sir!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
You mind if I take a look at this?
What's wrong?
And?
Was there such a thing?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Doc eat already?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Jesus Christ...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Where the hell've you been?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
How's astronaut training?
What can we do?
They know, don't they?
What are you doing?
We made it!
Excuse me, sir...
No!
Charge set?
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Thank you, Martin.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Made your million, yet?
You read Russian?
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
So that's all you do?...
It's Sixpack!
How'd you do that?
Getting some food.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
How is he?
What's wrong?
It needs blood?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
Are you sure you saw something?
It saw us!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
I'll kill him!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
Well?
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
I hate these Southern shites.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Son?
You all right back there, mate?
How long has he been in there, son?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
And look what happened to that.
That's it all done, we are off.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
Well, what did he say?
Tom, this is our case.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Hello, can I help you?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you doing, Plank?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
What's left over?'
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
So you knew this young man before?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Skinny?
Charley Wade.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
That's not the point.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Same weight I always was.
No. You?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
350 pounds.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
You've been in this house for a while?
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Same as they done in Mexico.
Well--
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Something like that.
Right.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
You going to get married?
Hey, Mikey--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
So where does that put us?
We been through this before--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
That where he was shot?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Right.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
You have somebody else out there?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Tell that one, Hollis--
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Never heard from him again?
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
I haven't been out here for a while.
No.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
He still living?
You thought any more about our murder?
I got an idea what happened.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
People didn't complain?
I don't think you can take it personally--
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
You gonna stay out here?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Morning, Sheriff.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Murdered him?
He's all yours.
Field trip?
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
How long have you lived here?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
You're out early.
Yeah.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
You going to tell her?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
Maybe they're not tricks.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
I don't want him getting in the way.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
He's good.
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Stuff?
He taught all this to Swann?
Harry?
... oh... God...
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Where the fuck is he?
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
With what?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
Why'd you come here?
What for?
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I can't let you in.
Are you satisfied now?
Was that Swann's idea?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
She has no real grip on reality.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Hold on.
Or murdered, like Nix.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
... no...
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yeah, they told me.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
What are you doing here?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
What did you study?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Did I scowl at you?
Oh.
Yeah? But look at you.
But, I'm mean.
I know.
You are.
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
What do you want to drink?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
My stockings.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
You wanna come?
I miss you.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
It's amazing  there!
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
You never said anything to me...
What?  That's horrible!
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
You'll do it?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Well I know he's come here before.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I'll bet.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Why did he try to kill me?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Get up!!
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
Plenty of time.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
How much time do we have?
Hello?
Maya?  What do you mean?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
It's useless...look at him.
You don't want to face it.
What do you mean by that?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
What happened?
nothing.
That's not funny
What?
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
What?
Can I take your coat?
That was nice.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
So how long is this trip?
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
A horse?
No.
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
What's that?
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
You do act different.
I think we gotta kiss now.
I want to ride my own bike.
I don't have to do what you say.
What's that?
Didn't know you cared so much.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
That's it, give it your best shot.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
Four.
You finish the reading for E-con?
What'd it say?
What?
It's okay, little baby.
Kiss my booty.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
he's just playing, Q...
Hey.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least she had time for me.
Just something I'm trying.
Tried calling you a couple times.
It just isn't.
You're out of your mind.
With who?
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Guess he talked to you.
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
From your mouth.
Good.
Oh, she's fine.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
I don't wanna talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
For what?
No.
What are you lookin' for?
You take cream or sugar?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Why not?
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
Well.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
It's ok --
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
....do you know who I am?
Picky, picky.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
You see?
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
You don't need braces.
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
I need to sit down.
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
...ah...
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
I think you have the wrong number.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Are you asking me that?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
And your father?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
How long have you taken care of him?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
When did he go off chemo?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
It's interesting.
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
I AM CALM.
What does it look like?
I live alone.
Marcie.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
What the hell is this Marcie?
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Will you say my name?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm sorry.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Slowly or quickly?
I love you.
That's it.
Just once.
Two years...three years...
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
No.
Hello?
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't want any water?
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Partridge?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Be ready at two --
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You ready to keep winning?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
..sorry...
What is that?
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
What -- ?
Mother -- ?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
And people close to him, who --
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
Now.  You were saying?
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Pull them back!
Forgiveness.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Coming?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
What do we do now?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
But -- are you sure?
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
It's been too long.
Thanks, but not for me.
I heard your playing.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
Raoul is everything to me.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
A personal nature?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
I was told this impostor was dead!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
... The ball... Continue.
What number, on the first page?
Magnificent valor...
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Exactly why it should be given away.
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
Every step of the way.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
We're by Ozone...
You can cut the shit, asshole--
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Where is he?!!
Speak of the devil.
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
What's going on here?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I'm stranded out here.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
No.  It wasn't like that!
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
You look all right now.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
For Christ's sake, why?
Who did he ask for?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Run it.
Who is it?
Get me a plane...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's not over yet.
Will?
That's why the boltcutter.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
When do you need it?
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
How did you come to Gateway?
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Who?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
She'll be in, in the morning...
Okay.
I don't understand.
'Intimate? !"
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
To yourself...
He asked how you are.
At the store. You doin' some good?
To do what?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
And... where are things?
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Lt. Fisk said...
I figured I'd ask you...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
How did it happen?
How?
You went in the apartment?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Did you get my card?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Do you have the file with you
What were the yards like?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Why does it feel good?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Kevlar Second Chance.
You have to do it.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
Really?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
And all this will be for real?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Hey Andy, good show.
Each show is worse than the next.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Are you at peace with your family?
Goals are important.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Can I help you with something?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Is he in his room?
I saw Michael!
Why is he saying these things?!
Then the informant is real.
The sewers.  Of course.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Who is it?
Don't be ridiculous.
Did you hear that?
Do you always look at it encoded?
Why you're here?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Operator.
Just get me outta here.
What is he doing?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
No!  It's too far away.
Do you still want to meet?
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
Hello, Neo.
My name is Trinity.
Who is?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
God...
But an Oracle can.
Should I be?
What happened?
What?
No one has ever done anything like this.
Neo, how did you do that?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Can you fly that thing.
You don't have...
Zion?
It's a city?
How?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Why?
Operator.
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
Know where he is?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
Where to?
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Waddaya think?
What happened to you Flash?
It's the truth, I swear.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Let's get out of here.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Keep your mouth shut.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
How much?
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Where's the rest?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Hey, where you been?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Nothing.
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Please take it.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You know why...with my parents.
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Yeah, it's your father's.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
His wife?
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
What, honey?
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
What about the Mayor?
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
What do you do that for?
Red or white?
Hello, Beautiful.
Well... goodnight.
I didn't say.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
In my sleep.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
Is there any more to it?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Why?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Whose?
That's it?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Yeah, that's what he said.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
What you then?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Yes?
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
Yes...
Where are you going?
'To bed'?
Almost.
You're here?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
He's taking a nap.
Did you like making love to me?
Well -- I --
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know so little about each other --
Will it?
I - uh --
No --
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Good morning.
Bill --
How about giving a guy a break?
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Are you going to eat your lunch
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Why did you go to the hospital?
I'm not hungry.
Yes, I saw you see me.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Thanks.
What the hell do you care?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Which is what?
So that's what love is?
Those were my words, Bill.
Are you threatening me?
I told you to shut up.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
An offense --
Yes.
That's me.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you?  Are you there?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
'The one' to do what?
Get what?
I'm sorry --
The 'question' --
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Eddie?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
What?!
It'll come back, Daddy.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Nothing lasts.
How'd you know?
Not at all.
I've got patients coming in --
Why?
78.
79.
69.
Should I wear it?
You don't know?
Condition?
My wife.
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
They treating you alright?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
So I just take your word?
What?
Such as?
His name was Jimmy.
Kill him.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Calm down.
Beer, please.
There's a dress code?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I don't think so.
She couldn't.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How'd you know I was in here?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
It is now.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Oh, yeah...
Yeah?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
I don't know.
How many?
How fast does that go?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Your father?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Like...?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
No part of it wasn't real.
Packaging?
What's our deal?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Like...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
What's your take?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
That's right.
How?
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
You okay?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
That sonofabitch!
This the load you lost a while back?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Oh hell, forget it.
What's in your socks?
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Where'd that come from?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
They wrong?
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Thanks, Joe.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
You really want to do business?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
The kids? Why are they...
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Yeah. How's Mom?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Yes.  I think so.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Feeling all right?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
How much did you have?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Oh we... we...
What?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Hishradyo.
Just got some news on Bell.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
Jeremy...
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
There's some weird shit here.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
And a right.
The Department of Public Health...
We'll be back at the platform in...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Oh, that's gonna work.
What?
You feel anything?
Can we get this car there?
What are you doing down here?
But the power...
Which way?
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
No...
Hello.
What?
It bit you.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
What's it about?
I can take it, go ahead.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
You want me to burn my book?
You want me to burn my book?
See, isn't this nice?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
It'll only take a second.
Well, it certainly says you.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Don't talk to me like that.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Yes, Paul.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I thought you were over it.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
How grateful?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Magic...
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Fight a bit of a cold..
There it is, guys, the last of it.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
What you got there, mate?
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
There she is.  I got visual.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
They've got a book for this?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
And that's the only reason?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
What did you think of him?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
And then what?
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I don't.  No exactly.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..I'm fine..and you?
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Luther, I'm looking at security.
You have Bellerophon.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
To friends.
Only four more cars.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
You knew about Jim?
Is he serious?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I'm walking.
You were in the car!
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
May I come in?
Kittridge...
What are you going to do?
What happened?
Okay...
Claire...Hey...
Claire.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
It's quite out of the question.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
What was your deal with Job?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Would you remove your hat please?
I thought I'd take some now.
How was Chicago?
Where are you?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whatís going to make him do that?
I usually am.
You got it.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
I knew about Jim.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Who's dead?
I won't pay for nothing.
Rita. Pass the wine.
You're welcome.
I don't know what you mean.
You're not sleepy?
I'm getting married.
He got hit by a bus.
You're my father.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
That's it.
How many men since then?
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Loretta.
I'm marrying your brother!
What did I do?
Snap out of it!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
What are you talking about?
Hi.
Kinda gaudy.
That was just so... awful!
What do you want to do now?
I'm here!
Hi Loretta.
You don't want the fish.
Yes, on the floor.
I like this ring.
What time is it?
What about the wedding?
How near is she to death?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I have no secrets from my family.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
What?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
No. But I have a hangover.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Hi.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I know.
Don't fight.
Talk to him.
Loretta...
May I presume to ask you a question?
Thanks, comrade.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Temperature's dropping.
Burn her anyway.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Where did you get the coconuts?
King of the WHO?
The same!
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
Yes ...
What is that?
What word?
Then you shall die.
I move for no man.
Now what happens?
Ni!
Ni!
What with?
What?
What?
Who are they?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
You know my name?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Where?
Oh, shut up.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Yes, Lord.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
I feel fine.
What is your favorite colour?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Don't be such a baby.
I can't.
Well taken, Concorde!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Do you want to come and have a drink?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
If we ... er ... 
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Well, look er, I ...
Well, she's got a point.
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
Sir Gawain.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
They're all saying the word ...
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She loved him.
What?
And she sent no word down?
You should have someone look after you.
It's what the maids are for.
Checked and locked, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I wish to see my mother.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Mother....
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
Checked and locked, sir.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
No.
Go inside at once.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
That can wait till the weekend.
This is a slur on her good name.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Surely --
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
They don't see it.
No loyalty.
Mr Brown.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Is that not enough?
What did he want?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Erysipelas.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Where did you find it by the way?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Has he been hurt?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What do they want?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Dead?
Maybe he's not dead.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
Nick...
I have to talk to you.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Well?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Change the channel!
Where do we go?
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Then where do we go?!
Virgin sacrifices?
Alex...
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Our time's up.
What the fuck is that?!
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
What is it?
I'm thinking!
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
It means she's screwed up.
They fired everyone.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
So what's the problem?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
It will work out.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Get going. You don't want to be late.
That's okay.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Number 17.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
I think I've been hurt.
No.
No...I need to sleep.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
What's wrong with that?
"So... surprise"...
Yes, Sir.
I had a dream about this place.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Hardly.
Is that it ?
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Do you know where you're going ?
What was that ?
What about you ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Is it over ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Trust is earned not given away.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
What was that ?
What's next ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Thank you very much.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Hello.
What an incredible view !
Are you okay ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
Are you okay ?
How's your foot ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
What now ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Okay, no problem.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Totally.
I will. How's Shelly?
I don't know if I want to.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Sure am, who are you?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
I know that.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Hello.
This is really very nice of you.
He's writing. Hello?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Thanks
Don't wake up Vada.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Care for a smoke?
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Where are you going???
You mean,  this ring?
Never heard of her.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Yeah?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
She lives here too?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Maybe.
I should do this myself.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He was caressing.
Hi!
I think this place is just fine.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
I'm just tired.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Why not now?
He's a great poet.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
You are perfectly healthy.
Can't you see it?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Hi.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Home sweet home.
Do you want to?
How's it going chef?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Well, you were pretty great!
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Ahem.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
The money?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
She likes to play bingo.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
Did I kill my mother?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
In the garage.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Please.
Who's that?
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Shut your big fat mouth!
Did you read ALL these books?
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Sure.
Are you going out somewhere?
NO!
I'm hemorrhaging.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
No, I'm going home.
Naah, I don't wanna.
Your lip bleeding?
Where's your bike?
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Got it!
Jump in the water!!
Get up!?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
What?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
I've lost interest.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Zit cream?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
And the answer was so simple.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Exactly what?
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
I saw the show.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
What's the sec...
Waiter! Check, please!
Should I whistle down a cab?
You never eat when you're despondent.
Big weddings are so strange.
Don't you throw up on boat?
Where did we first hear th...
No accents today.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm up against a deadline.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
This is her family and her fault.
Does that make it right...
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
I said, I've been real tired.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
What do you really want?
Yes.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
His Word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
That's what he wants.
National television?
Where'd he ever see us?
Okay.
Bastard
President?
You're kidding.
Where are you going?
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
He's my father.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Mr. Green?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
You know anything about the stations here?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You must really like him.
She had on high heels?
You in music?
Parts.
Fungus?
Well, can you tell me why?
Well...How have you been?
When did you think it would happen?
I knew when I first met you.
I'm twenty-eight
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
You know who that is?
What time?
What National TV...?
Where are you going?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
I'm Opal.
Pleasure
What do you think of him?
You go to school together?
Oh --
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Got me an audition tonight.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Which do you recommend?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Where's it parked?
Just wait one fucking minute.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I admire them.
Yes.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
How immediate is immediately?
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
What the hell happened to you?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
How's it working, Scotty?
Rollin'...and speed!
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Ya know, I was.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Give her a beer.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
Fill her up?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
I said: Cut it out!
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
That's two bucks, Joe.
You working?
Your folks live there?
Yes, aren't you?
My father's the preacher.
How about another beer?
They must work on the section gang.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
How come you stay 'round here?
But I would like to see you again.
What?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
How did it go?
Your boy.
What d'you mean?
I can see why.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Is that so?
My kids want me to teach them.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Day work.
How come you don't hate their guts?
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Where' you goin'?
They all got families to support.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Well, what're you going to do?
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Hello.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
What about her?
What the hell is that?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
And then?
You ran without us.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
What are you talkin' about?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Where did you here that?
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
How long have I been out?
I'm going in.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
...Feels like you.
He projects with neural implants.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Shit...
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
I'm still going in.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Like what?
What?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
What is with this school and prom?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It is?
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Well excuse me.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Okay. That's bad.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
You need my help?
George! What are you doing here?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
How many times have I fired her?
Gus?
That's your story!
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Are you--scared?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
That is so sad --
Josie, you look Rufus.
Wow - I-
Where're we taking him?
Yes.
Taste it.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Help me with this thing!
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
What's all this.
Disappointed?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
What's so funny?
So, school going alright?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Hi, guys.
Yor dad picking the music again?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
I'm sure you would.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Girl, what are you doing?
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Horseshit.
So what do we do about this creep?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
That was different.
Freddy?
What's that?
Nancy!
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
Stop blaming yourself.
You sound like Peter Pan.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
Science...I suppose.
I could've saved them.
My God.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Sorry about that...
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Okay.
Floppy, huh?
Too complicated.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Whoopsidaisies.
No, I didn't.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
So who left who?
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Wow.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Can I have your autograph?
Yup.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Bernie.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Hello, Bernie.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Buggered?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Hello.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Can I help you?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Oh my God...  Hello.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Are you sure you...?
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Yes, Billy?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
I hope everything is settled.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Whatcha boys playin'?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
A bus?
Yeah, kid?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Yeah, where we going?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Ya know what, Fred?
What are you doing?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
I said out!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Don't you have any clubs?
Let me see your hand!
Big king, too bad...
Who told you that?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me!
Right!
I wanna go home!
My turn.
Jesus God...
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
That's correct, Doc ...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Time out!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Ten bucks.
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Somebody's coming!
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
You know, I never got your name.
He's a patient, Rose...
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
We found each other, didn't we?
You...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
You're limping.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Why not?
So.  You found him.
What?...
You okay?
Hi.
There's no such thing.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Been here long?
Excuse me?
What looks good?
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't believe in statistics.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Kate, is something the matter?
Have you seen him with someone?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Now what do we do?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
That was really sweet...
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi-iii...
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter found him?
Amazing...
And he is living proof.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
What about Larry?
And you are?...
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
How old are you?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
But my own kid bro—
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Terry...?
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
I'd better go in.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
How do you like that one?
Now what are you doing?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Terry!
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
You're not sore at me?
What are you crying for?
It's true.
You... .
I know what you want me to do!
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, no, no... .
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
My pigeons... .
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
But you've got to listen to me.
About Edie?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
I want to see you, Terry.
This is my business.
What did you say?
...walk?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
You was a Golden Warrior.
Give me a double.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Listen— Nolan—
If I could get my hands on you...
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
What do you mean?
I'm so frightened.
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
What kind of symbol?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
The moon is almost gone!
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
No. No! No!
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
What're you talking about?
Lie face down on the floor.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
It's Richard Ripley.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Just that she got away.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
We made it, didn't we?
I have to qualify, is that it?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Ironic, isn't it?
Quite a mess.
Who?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
You know how to use one a these?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
You comfy?
That's funny.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
We still talk, though.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I mean, romantically.
You know who this is?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
A girl.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
Well, does it make sense to you?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You were going to see her?
You getting serious on me now?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You think he's lying?
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Weren't you expecting us?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Really?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Have they got Midge up there?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
She did, huh.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Gee, I wonder why not.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Can we change the subject?
What are you thinking about?
He doesn't even look like that.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
You gonna go get him?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
I think he must've fell in.
...the fuck is this...
Are you sure they're here?
I wish she could forget him.
You're Walker, right?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
What lizard?
Yeah.
I didn't mean it.
We gotta face some facts here.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Get me into a plane!
They're all over us!
Land of the free.
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Danny...
Then wh-where do we land?
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Win?
What do you get for winning?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
Rafe --
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Leapin' Jesus!
Hello, Lilla!
They're waiting. Come on.
I don't get it.
We're here on the sofa bed...
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
How do you feel?
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Looking good out there.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
He's trying.
Charlie, let's make love.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Did you study for the test?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Damn that Charlie I
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
The hat business is in trouble.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
What are you doing?
And the butter.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
You look exactly the same.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
What a great kite.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Okay. I promise.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
What will they be made of?
Silicon is from sand.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
What's the matter?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I think so.
Who was that?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
How long have you been here?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Yes!
What in God's name... ?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Why are you getting dressed?
What's wrong with you?
Thanks for coming in.
Client of yours?
Congratulations.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Thanks for your time.
Who'd you get?
How did they find out?
One more thing, Your Honor...
PARRTYY!
Get it?
Beckett?
What?
We proceed, representing your estate.
I know a good probate lawyer.
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
Except... you were gay?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Thanks for coming by.
Rach.
What kind of movies do they show there?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
In some situations.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Hello?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Mom?
Were you recently promoted?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Leave that.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
A homosexual encounter.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Were you pleased with his work?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Don't know, Joe.
Now that you mention it...
Going on... like...?
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Let's continue.
Julius!
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
You came for us....
Tell me that was you.
Bring the light!
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Why, what'd you hear?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Just come with me!
What do my eyes see?
There....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
S'matter?
What?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Didn't bite.
He used that?
So why isn't it all bloody?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Well? Is it just the pump?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Frightening thought.
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Hasan?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
Suleiman!
New Mecca....
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
How did you know we'd come here?
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Seal the cave?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Landon! Join the expedition.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Sustained.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Of course.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
It's him...Landon.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Taylor! Tell him.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But the proof? The doll?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Come on man!
...But what'd she do?
...beautiful night.
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
What are you talking about! 
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Right on.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
You wanted to see me sir?
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I think you're drunk.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Certainly not to me.
Cold?
Want to dance?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Would I want to?
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
FLorida?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You've had dealings with the police before?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Private eye?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
And without much discrimination.
What's this in favor of?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Passkey?
You nasty, sardonic--
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Send that?
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
What do I get for it?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
No suicide.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
I am a fool.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
How long have you had it?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
History books are first onto the bonfires.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Shall we go?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Congratulations.  Who with?
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
I called you a taxi.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't seen much of you.
Might?
Not here.
Not yet you know any of these people?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Bastard.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
What have you been up to?
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Perhaps I will, then.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
What would you call it?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
Don't point it at James!
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Ah, Susy, it...
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Friends of yours, huh?
Don't you gamble?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
You gotta tell me where she is.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Got it.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
I... I gotta go.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
I'll see you there.
Any sign of the hostages?
What's got Billy so spooked?
What's he got?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Georgia.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I like your hat.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
No, you look like a hooker.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
No, but it's getting there.
What's your name, lover.
Where'd you go?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Not... quite.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Why not?
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fuck off.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Cynthia's not coming?
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Why do you want to know?
What!?
You broke my nose.
All this because of that whore!
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Couple a hours.
I got a dress.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Then you would use your--
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Get out!
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
My Westley will always come for me.
He will come for me.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Does it bother you to hear?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
I don't think more than ten.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Inigo.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
What? What?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Rise and report.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
Could this be a trap?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Where's Fezzik?
-- all that I have and more please --
Sir. Sir.
Sixty-five.
Thank you for everything.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
I want to duel him left-handed.
I accept.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
You feeling any better?
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Yes sir.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Here, don't panic.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
What was I saying?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Where would you like to eat?
What kind now, Leo?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
It won't run a week!
What are you doing?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Maybe it's not true!
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vat about it?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Vaaaat???
Not.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Do it!  Do it!
Do you need us?
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
I'm Mary's sister.
Here?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I ought to call the police right now!
She haven't even called you?
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Huh?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Sorry.
What?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Is your time so empty?
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
That's it. 
You slept here all night?
Is anything wrong?
Is there?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
...Forty thousand dollars!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
But where do the rats come in?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What is it now?
That spoke to you?
Your father?
Did you hear?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
Yes, why?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
Let me go! Let me go!
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
What do you mean police dog?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Fine, thanks.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
You weren't going with her?
That happens to be the truth.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
What is it? What happened?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Is that a fact?
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Could we go somewhere?
Of what?
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
I know, Mother.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
I do, too!
Of course not!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Are they polar bears, too?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Please do.
How goes it, darlin'?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
You're so sweet.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, it was a silly question.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
What's the matter with him?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
How much?
And... ?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Kittle...
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
That's sick.
Dean Martin.
They... they shot me.
What day is it?
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
You could start over again with cash like that.
Can't I?
He went to pick up lunch.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Yeah... great.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Alright?
I'm gonna get beside him.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Why the beach?
Do tell.
You always did have style.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Vader's on that ship.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Someone who loves you.
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Good luck.
What are you telling them?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
There it is!
Then you know why I have to face him.
Come with me.
Well, I'm sorry.
Yes or no will do.
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He might be.  I don't know.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
What was that bang?
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Oh Brad.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
What guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
"Transylvania"
Dealing
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Creature of the night.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
It's Thanksgiving.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I just dislocated my finger.
Would ya like a glass of water?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
I always knew you was pretty.
Don't you open them anymore?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...And he called the reporters --
What was that you said about a pet shop?
What did you say about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
Paulie, please --
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Don't do that again!
He won't last one round.
My side.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
How was the flight, Champ?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Did ya get the license number?
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
...That's an old one.
Here -- Three minutes.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Ya still light seventy.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
What?
Did you hear what I said?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
The legs must be goin'.
...Who'd ya fight?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Whatta you get outta this?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Ya nose is broke.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
How I look out there, Mick?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Hey --
Don't get mental, man.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
What's ya sister like to do?
I'll do okay.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Ya really like her?
What gaps?
You ballin' her?
To see ya train.
...I can't haul meat no more.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
I'll tear his head off.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Is this paper even good?
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
So you decided to help him after all?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
How did you get onto Doom?
So where is it?
Now what?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
What the hell are you doin'?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
I'll get it.
Two bits.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
A challenge, on my life.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Good heart, at what?
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Goodnight.
[Within] Juliet!
What?
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
By the hour of nine.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
That dreamers often lie.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
It's under your seat.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
I don't know.
Well I don't!
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Not to me, you know that.
Lose them!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
Now, what did we steal?
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Who are you?  IRA?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Do you have the material?
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Sent it where?
How so?
Then I guess we're set.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Is that right?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
What's the difference?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
What's going on?
He's going back.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Clearly.
The Irish representative?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I never made that claim.
Give me a cigarette.
I'm not here very much.
That's a good question.
You have to stop doing that!
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
I know.
I told you, I quit.
Gaelic.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Can you get it?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Ten thousand right here.
Well someone's gonna find them.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
I don't know...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
He's going to be trouble.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
It's gonna be o.k.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Whoa, Earl!
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
So do I.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Why does that bother you?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Sally, do you love me?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
What do you think about all this?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Sheriff Hogan --
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Damn it’s hot in here...
She's not his type.
Why?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
It was going to be a surprise!
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
You'd do this to me?!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
I'm not asking.
Don't hurt me.
How's work?
That's great Earl!
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Yeah, that's right.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
You bring American money?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
What'd I say?
What are you doing?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
It's my job!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Who?
How do you know he's our man?
It's a long story.
No.  It was my singing.
I wouldn't do that!!!
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Well we're not friends.
Fine with me.
See you in the next world.
How was the sex?
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
What is this?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I could use a little vacation.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Lee!  It's him!
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
That silly-ass look on your face.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
What?
Now, that's American music.
You know War?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Oh no, I dropped it.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
You got a lot of guts calling me.
How about a lift home?
I'm talking about the girl.
Yo, Johnson...
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
My daughter.
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I will not have friends in America.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Yes.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Rub your ears.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Maggie!
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
What?
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
They made me put my hat back on.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Too much.
Maybe someday.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
You look... uh... You look fine.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Where did you disappear to?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
I'm listening.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
He's going to be the pastor?
Grandma!
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I'm really rooting for this one.
A harmless joke.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
You tell Maggie.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Is that all right with you?
I'll wait.
It's delicious, trust me.
You go.
Walter.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Oh!
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Did you talk to him?
I love you, too.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What about the letter?
Go home for the weekend.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Magic.  It was magic.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Which means --
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Why not?
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Hey, my plate is full.
You'll like it.
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
It's Y. O. H.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Will she scratch up your back?
It was sinking.
This one's for both of us.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Have you seen my wallet?
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Do you like baseball?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Hi.
I thought you were never going to call me.
He's ten.
It takes time --
You're welcome to one.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Mornin'.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
How goes it?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
To the mine?
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Let them take it!
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
A meeting?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Ramón -- you can't.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Go on. Spill it.
Where's your mama?
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
What?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
It's not that easy.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Oh. Hi.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Is that how you play?
It gets me through the day.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
How much time do you have?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
Who is it?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
How you holding up?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
What?
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Can I ask you something?
Was he the president?
Okay
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
Now get talkin'
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Danny, I'm touched.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
I was trying to score some dope.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Murder.  Beautiful.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Please ... don't do this ...
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Turns out he's connected.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What's that smell?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Where's Bubba?
What is that? Rum and coke?
Find a chaplain.
Report.
Resistance?
So, where are you from?
As a matter of fact, I am.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Yep.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Watching.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Good luck, Captain.
That only leaves three.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
What'd you say, Captain?
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
You think they'll be alright?
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
You alright?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Shit, sir.
Frogs?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
How do you do it?
What's the profile?
No, no he's not.
Hi.
Lloyd?
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
That's not even a scam.
What does it say?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd, it's us.
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Why?
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
I'm sorry.
What?
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
You should be.
Did he ever get rough with you?
I swear to god.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
This is me telling you about me.
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
What are these?
He does this every year?
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
So what's your job this summer?
I think you should wear that.
Okay, bye.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
It's okay, everybody does that.
No.
Yeah.  With potential.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Are you comfortable?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Okay, what did we just decide?
Yeah you do.
You told your dad?
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
Okay.
Good to know.
Okay.
It's your castle, man.
Yeah.
YEAH!
Seriously, Lloyd.
No, really.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Just her name.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Oh boy.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
I love you man
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Well, let's find him.
What -
All right, okay, let's talk.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
You want these people.
What's that?
What do I got for you?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Thank you.
It kind of looks that way.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
I was just the accountant.
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
Pots and pans.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
I got to go, I'll see you.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
We need to talk.
I can do it, Captain.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
Have you checked the...
I would say we are now officially baffled.
I heard a noise.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
Yes.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
What if I said goodbye?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Cotton.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I did that.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Fair enough.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Where is Sidney's father?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
About what?
Lemme take you home.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
And now, drum roll please...
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
We had to have financing.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
This is all too familiar.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
I don't play games.
What do you mean?
Yes, goddammit!
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
That was good.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
And white.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
How is that good news?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Yeah?
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Why would the police come to you?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
You used to say that was our strength.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
It is in my script.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
You're dead!
Where?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
I didn't kill anybody.
How'd you do?
You ready to party hard tonight?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
She can't get both of us.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
What are you doing here?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
So...
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Sshh... it's okay.
You heard me.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
What?
Popcorn.
Uh-huh.
What did you say?
That's not what you said.
How do you know his name?
What kind of game?
I don't know...
What's his name?
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
...leave me alone... please...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
And why is that? Has something happened?
He's not a suspect, is he?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
Does mom know?
Any word on my Dad?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
You girls ready.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
Please. You owe me.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Many times.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Are you okay?
...so call if you need me.
Stu was with me last night.
You coming tonight?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
So what's his reason?
There goes my chance with Sid.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Who?
TATUM!
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
Give me the gun.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
A woman...
You should be thanking me.
I... I don't follow.
Who said this was murder?
You think it was poison?
It could be nothing.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
You go to movies at least?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No witnesses of any kind?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
Are you alright?
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Put your gun down!!
Are you absolutely certain?
I don't know, with this case.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
Got a warrant?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
What in...?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
How'd you come by this?
Well, come on!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Hey! What's the idea...?
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
You ask her!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
No...She's not...
Lemme alone...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
They'll be back...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Where?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Who was that?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Where have you been?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Maybe an animal.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
Martin, what-
Hello.  Can I help you?
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Well, look here!
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Oh…what have I done?
Do you know that house?
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
We have no Juliet!
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Most interesting.
Will it restore my gift?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
This time we take your boots off!
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Who is she this time?!
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Nobody. The author.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
The show must … you know
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
What is the story?
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
Ethel.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Like Valentine and Silvia?
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Your mother, and your father
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Your Majesty
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
Like you, I found him not at home!
My lady!
You can bring them with a word.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Then I will go with you.
Will! What--?
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Will you read it for me?
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
But all ends well.
I have spoken with your father.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Your name?
Yes, sir.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
She loves me, Thomas!
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
But what of Lord Wessex?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
All right, just a few questions.
I was trying to educate you.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I won't be able to.
That was good.
Doesn't it worry you?
Not eating what?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
But they know.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Don't know what?
No. Why should it?
Just one thing.
Right.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yes.
I thought you stopped going.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
Who was it?
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- which is --
The man we know and love.
Hugo.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
What are you doing?
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
Hello. Hello.
Leave him alone.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
Aren't you going to answer it?
You'll wait in the hall?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
So, uh...
Downstairs.
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
Why do you want a room here?
Would you like to talk about it?
Do you know many of these people?
Expecting anyone?
Here.
In this firm.
You must be Hugo.
I see.
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Shall I answer it?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
No. I haven't seen them.
Diseases.
Offering it for debate.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Then what's the problem?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That's George.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Why not?
She did?
I'll be back in a while.
You're late, George.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I know.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
That headboard.
You going to answer it?
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
What?
No shit.
Yeah...
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
You're late, George.
How long you had this?
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
What's wrong?
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
George...
Sit down.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
That sounds like me.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
Look about last night --
-- It's Malone's.
Well then what are you trying to do-
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
Yeah!
Here in the canyon.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
You're different.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Hey, I'm, you know --
George.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Egypt.
When is that?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
I've got to get her out of here.
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
You did fuck him, didn't you?
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, don't do this --
-- please, baby --
What? What? What? What? What?
Yes, yes, I did.
What're you here for?
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But what?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Sorry, honey, I...
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
You live like a pig.
All night.
Godammit, George...
Did they have something against me?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Why, why do you think that is?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
What about Jackie?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

I'm coming over.

Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
Of course not.
No.
Does she know about us?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
What?
-- Yesss?
-- uhh-huhh...
But why Egypt?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Thank you.
Do you have something against traveling?
Yes.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Are you sure?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Yes.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Jack...
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
What sort of injury did he have?
How did he manage to do that?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
It's okay, really.
Sure.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
No.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
I did?
Bill, how do you do?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
What'll it be?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Get him out of here?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Have any trouble finding us?
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I don't believe they did.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
What's the money for?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
Really.
SING!
How come?  Sister?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What you do?
How are you doing.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Okay, Christy -- strip.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh my! 
HE'S SO FINE.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
What?
Shirelles.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Babies
She's a pro.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Van Cartier.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
Come on, we're late.
Three years.  A rookie.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
We need experience.
Mary Clarence!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Miss Van Cartier.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
It never solves anything.
Really catching on.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
You sent for me?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
No nothing.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I just need a few more weeks,
I am?
Really?  Lieutenant?
Vince knows you're here.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
And if she runs?
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
What's she doing?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Reverend Mother?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Who took the meat?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
He is a behemoth.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Very few, if any.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Listen to what you say....
What is it?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What is it?
All I saw was their lantern.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What was she doing?
What now?  Where is she?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
You promised justice.
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What is so urgent?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The church.
Use caution.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
You... you are alive.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
How'd your baptizin' go?
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
You like that Vaughan?
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
Don't hit that boy no more.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Did you want to play ball with us?
They still around, your folks?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
You want to go with me?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
It was alive?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Yeah.
You scared me.
Why are you here now?
Yes sir.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
I didn't mean that.
Will he be supervised?
Will that be cash or charge?
Not an easy book.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Do me a favor, will you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
A photographer ...
They're all the same.
I've never seen anything like it.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Like what?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
It's for you.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
What are you talking about?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Of course. Where else?
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
I didn't expect to see you again.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Where did you get that thing?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
Yeah, it might be.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Now, Mister Gi...
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You don't believe in God anymore.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Well, what then, sergeant?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Robbed.  He was angry.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
What makes you think I play?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
And what's that?
You want me to say that.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
I believe so.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
And her farmhouse...?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Wanna see my driver's license?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
What happened?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
You mean it's a girls' band?
You've flipped your wig!
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Men?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
Oh, he does!
And where's he going to be?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you doing with my flowers?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
I'll say there is!
Like when?
What are you giving me with the omelette?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Sugar?
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Did you hear that?
She sings, too.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
And your head is hot.
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Not you, Sugar.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Where did you girls play before?
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Another bridesmaid?
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
We can have it altered.
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
I don't like no witnesses.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Oh?
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
Well, here we are.
Afford it?
Me?
Really?
You know - I play tenor sax.
You don't say?
Brains aren't everything.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Want to switch berths with me?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Thank you.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your face is familiar.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Shell Oil?
The most wonderful thing happened -
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
I seem to be out of gas.
Where's your shell collection?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Harmless - how?
Complete washout.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
What else is there for me? 
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
What's the matter, Sugar?
Daphne -
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Refresh my memory.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what I love about all this?
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
I should get going.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
What’s his problem?
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Ah, a philosopher.
Crikey.
Hey, you!
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
That was a long time ago.
So, what’s your point?
What color are my shoes?
Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
Mmm.
What does your gut say?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Are you sure?
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
What?
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah. You?
I should go.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
You pawned it.
So why’d you let him go?
“Not yet...”
I always wondered what happened with us.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I am now, sir.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Go on...
But, Charlie --
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
It's cold, Daddy!
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
When's that?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Who is they?
Any sign of Sounder?
Good night, Mama...
Who's Miss Johnson?
What's wrong with him, David?
What's wrong, Nathan?
Come, I'll take you home.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Whatcha got there?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
There, you see?
I just got out here!
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
What?
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Cartman?!
Mph rmpmh rm.
Mph rmph rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Mkay.
What?
Kyle?!
What's going on, Chef?
Hello there, children!!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Viva la Resistance.
Donkey raping shit eater.
Ber dada!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mrph?
Who is it?
What's the password?
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Oh my God...
What's a butfor?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's okay, I am done for.
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Nowhere.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
I thought you had something planned.
WHAT?
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
What did you do today Satan?
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Yeah!
You don't have watches?
Getting drunk is no solution.
Oh, thank you.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Where the hell did you come from?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
So, are you on for the next one?
Why, didn't they say?
You gotta think of your old age.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
It's time we lock coordinates.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Look at this...Jesus.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
What are we going to do?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Dawn!  Dawn!
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
Sooner than later.
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
Well now what are we gonna do!
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hey, you still here?
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
What's on your mind, Miles?
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Where'd you get this ball?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
What the fuck is this?
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
How's that?
I don't like to talk about it.
It depends.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Nice set-up.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Where's Junior?
After we eat, Dad.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Yeah.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I'm a bowler.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
This is a vicious cycle.
Where did your brother escape from?
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Come on, bargain with me.
What are you going to do about your brother?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
Sez you!
Very professional.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Who identified the body?
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Wait a minute --
Norman!
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
What have you been told so far?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
What for?
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Nothing, sir.
How much damage?
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
So?  What's the problem?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
How can he be missing?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Because when we get down there --
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
It's not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
Still clear?
You get it straightened out?
That wasn't in there before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Diphenyl parlene.
Nothing about drowsiness.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
I'm sorry.
What's wrong, Norman?
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You know what I mean.
Someone did.
You're insane.
Yes.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Get away from me!
How's that?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who?  The fish?
Then what is it?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Why are you looking at me like that?
How are you feeling, Norman?
You holding up alright?
You sound defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Getting anywhere with those?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
What does Norman already know?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Well, if it's a discharge --
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
What report?
What report?
You want me to try?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Well, he's polite.
Was it a military crash?
No, not anymore.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Good morning!
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
You saw through me?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
Of course, where you been kid?
Have you been checked out?
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Is he afraid of the water?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Did you read her mind ?
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
So what are you doing later ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Or...?
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Well, whad'ya know...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
WHERE IS IT ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
He's nothing like you.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
What happened to your hair ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Which way ?
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Where'd it come from ?
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
What ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Cover me.
Diz, see what you can do.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
...CUT OFF !
Mr. Rasczak.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
On whose authority, Corporal ?
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Let's go.
How bad are you, pal ?
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>?!
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Programming ready?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Hold station.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
I just got kicked off my first movie.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
How's your star?
Yeah, you?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Drama Group?
What, what what are you doing here?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
I wasn't doing business.
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Big day last night.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
He's on the ph...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
I will.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
It's Marty on the Coast -
That's right.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
No, you're absolutely r...
<u>Bobby</u>...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
I'm very sorry to...
Aren't you ever in school?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
No.
I love Jewish men.
You have to hide.
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
...I can't do it, Wally...
And you know what...?
...yes...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
That's cor...
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
What?
Why?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, the traffic light...
I have to talk to you.
...he's the producer of the movie.
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
And what was it you wanted to say?
Mmmm.  You have children?
I had a witness I would.
He saw the accident...?
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Town's out of lilacs.
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
We're out of money.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I've got a date.
I don't getcha.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
<u>Siddown</u>!
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
What did you say to them...?
I...
What is that...?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
We got the permit.
Yeah?
Wally...?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...the damn thing...
You think so?
Zat true?
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
I'm gonna call him.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
And what do you do wh...
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Great.  Big ears, too?
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You touched it.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
IS THAT YOU?
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
That I do.  Always will.
Mommy's sick, guys.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Okay.  These are good.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
You say that like I don't know that.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
Because you don't really seem here.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Called him.  We set an ap...
Still, please.
It's a huge moment in their life --
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
What happens next?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
I don't know wh...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Okay, I'm undeserving.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
She's devastated.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
And I'm going to win.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Ben never mentioned it.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You ride with Annabelle...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
They're my kids.
What a great surpri...
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
I needed some time away.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Where you goin'?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Hey.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
There are some rumors...
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Oh. How did it happen?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
But still, you can't be sure.
So whaddya think?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
We're not ready!
Don't even joke about that!
Twinkeys!
Sure!...
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
But what kind of pull did you have?
The same. Same as what?
OK.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Come here, give me a hug!
Hello, Vi.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Ni...
Nigger, fuck me hard!
I hate reading.
Who is this?
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
What for?
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
What is most important to you?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
--be prepared.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
How well do you know this place?
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
Enjoying the tour so far?
Go fuck yourself...
Come on, drink up.
So, what are we looking at White?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
How goes the roll call?
Where the hell could they have gone!
Good.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Can I have a glass of water?
I have your word, Mister President?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Give that back to me.
What are you talking about, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Yes, sir.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
That is correct, Major.
What shall we drink to, sir?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I see.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Right.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Do you think we'd cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Maximum ECM.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
They can't touch us at this height.
No kidding.
That's what I said.
Master safety.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Who's that?
Have you tried the emergency system?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Forget it.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
That was really great.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Typical male.
No I quit.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Don't let 'em fight.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
No, no.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
No. Life is too short.
Yeah.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
What?
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Ah, you know people there?
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
It's okay.
No, but I heard it was great.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
Will you stand up for me?
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
It's coming along.
Uh-huh.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
See ya later.
They let you out?
Yes.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Your completely missing the point.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
It got that close.
Oh, yeah?
Jeff. Jeff.
What?
What feelings?
Come with me.
New ground?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Wait, away?
You're unbelievable.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Hey, Pony.
Good, man.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
The prom. That's funny.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Really?
Now?
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look Pakeesa...
Get off my roof!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Yeah.
Yeah?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Fuck.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
I'm in, too.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
No.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
I'm sorry.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Madonna.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Kansas!
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah, hold on.
Ammo?
Hello?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
What the hell do you want?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Well....
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I was afraid of that.
You sure have.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
We've missed you too, dear.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Or shall I call my servant?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
I want you to do this work.
There sure is.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Keep it.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
When did he say it, Norma?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
He must be quite a guy.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Wanted what?
You are not dressed properly.
Uh-huh?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How is she?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Bring something to drink.
Paramount is calling.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
When can I see, you again ?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We can't do that.
Is this how?
She said it wouldn't last.
That makes it worse.
And now?
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
Oh no, not you again.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
No thanks. You go on.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You're wasting your breath.
Who are you ?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Zaltar, please help me.
There is a way.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You...um...you never got married?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
I can never get a way from it.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
He really was!
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
Do you really know Superman?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
When?
What?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Is this whitemail?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Everything.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
What about you?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Oh, Superman!
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Maybe I could try --
It is kinda romantic.
Who ????
I'm listening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Sleep well?
Everything on it?
Does Lois know about this yet?
A parka.
I like trees.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
This way Lex.
It has everything.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Superman! The --
You must be freezing.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Yes, but will you honor it?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
Look, they need a machine to fly.
You are master of all you survey.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
I've never been in a place like this before.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Oh . . . my . . .
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Impossible? Why?
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Awesome!
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Is he for real?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Where's Clark?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Boy, are you gonna get it.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Destroy Superman!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
I'll deal with you later.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Mom...
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Know what?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
So I've noticed.
Shut up.
What's the temperature now?
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
What do you suggest, my dear?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
No! You couldn't imagine -
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Superman???
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
It must feel great.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
I...uh...
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
There.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
I still don't get it.
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
Ally.  That's right.
Ally Jones.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
I...don't think so.
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
They just finished supper.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Because it's what we have to do.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
He knows that?  Billy?
You've talked to Billy?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Away from your crazy Mom.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
And winter?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
No.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It's like a song.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
I don't want you to lie.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Do you have a room?
What do you mean?
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Need a hand?
Is this it?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
What for?
I'm a lawyer.
Yes.
No.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
Why not?
Do you like the colour?
Yes.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Will the police do anything to her?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Come on boys, break it up...
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Can I come out?  No.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I know Steve.  No.
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
He means that much to you...?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
I thought he would.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
And where was his wife?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah!
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
But...
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
If that's for me, tear it up!
What's the matter?
Why me...?
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
J.J., if you think -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
You going to work all day?
I can't
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Do you know about the chip?
No good.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Radical.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Swear.
Does it hurt?
Affirmative.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Excellent.
Alriight!!  My man!
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
We don't have much time.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Mom?  You okay?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
Can it be destroyed?
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
The CPU from the first terminator.
What does he mean, too correct?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I guess so, sir.
So, what does the Russki want?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
You do shorthand and typing?
What's in those files?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
I made no deal!
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Then you are wrong.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I have no idea.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Do you know what that is?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Show me.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
I've remembered something else...
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
And ask him about his private life.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Yes, Chuck?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
About what?
Thanks a lot.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
Kyle?
Is this enough?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
My whole life has been combat.
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Why were the other two women killed?
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Here's her driver's license.
Send a unit.
Admittedly...
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
Are you finished?
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
I'm sorry, about this...
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Please...
I'll wait.
You deserted me.
Never did catch your name.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
What exactly do you do?
A fresh shirt...
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
What is it?
Do you mind if I sit?
Take the picture out.
What are you doing... ?
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
No.
Trust me.  Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
What's this all about, Connie?
Slow down, take a breath...
The phone's dead.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
How long will these take?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Hm?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Goodnight.  See you home.
What's the trouble?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
What?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Attractive...
Nicholas...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
And what kind of sleeper?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
Nell!
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Are you working with her?
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
All the carvings.
It was a stupid thing to do.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
What happened?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
Why?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
Not really.
How could he have left without his keys?
Theo... Did you?
That's so sad.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Are you sure?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Nell, what happened?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Not for you, clearly.
As soon as you get dressed.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
I like the colors.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
What.
Oh really?  Where you from?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I can take care of the paperwork.
CQ what?
Edward Rama?
Who done it, then?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
That was one of them?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Too easy?
Do you have any friends, man?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Why did you come here?
Weren't you on a television series?
Disappointed.
Modelling.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
-- Your employer?
Right.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Who remembers.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Don't you work with Ian?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Which kind?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
What?
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
What kind of trouble are you in?
Is he here?
Thanks.  You, too.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hello, Rachel.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hi, Mr Crane.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...I guess I've been all wet.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
Uh-huh.
How much to they want, Dave?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't get it.
Yeah.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
No thanks.
I'm fine.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Taking it seriously.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Jesus...
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
...We goin'?
Huh?
I don't understand.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
Yes, sir.
His eyes are open.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Yes.
Fifteen... what's next?
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Lieutenant --
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
I smell it.  It's here.
This place is a maze.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Lieutenant!  It's me.
It's still back there!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Like the claw.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
What's that?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
I'm coming with you.
Dr. Frock?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
What do you make of it, Margo?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Genetic damage?
For what?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Are we talking Emmies?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
The creator of what?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Sure she would.
Lauren, right?
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No...I, er.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
I've got to talk to you.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Stay where you are!
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
How did it go today?
Every time you and Marlon--
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
It'd be an adventure.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
What's the hurry?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Let's go now.
Truman, that was our house!
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
--Darling--
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Now what?
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
I think you better tell us.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Of what?
Yes.
Who called this meeting?
Do they know?
I'm looking for him.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Have you examined them?
Do I know you?
How'd you find me?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
You found something?
-- You saw this experiment?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
What? What are you talking about?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
I wake you?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Why are you whispering?
What did you find?
What did you find?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This is weird, Mulder.
We've got to keep moving.
Well, call General McAddie.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where is he?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Sing a song of sixpence...
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Damn him.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Agent Novak?
What about Julia?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
That went well.
He's mine?
Agent Cole.
Already there.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
She changed the codes.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
What about the cat?
You sure you want to go through with this?
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
...to steal my girl.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Wer ist da?
Have you seen Calloway?
...again.
...is there?
...Headquarters.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
They are - private - letters.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Where?
What is it?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
My name is Calloway.
You a friend of Lime's?
Been here long?
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Him dying like that.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
So would I.
...a week ago.
...in the morning.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Win what?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Heard of Harry Lime?
Seems exciting.
What's that?
Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Striptease, sir.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
...were of you.
Thank you.
Speak English?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
You remember me? Upstairs...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Harry...
What else did he tell you?
Passport, please.
Where are you staying?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Richard - I saw a fin!
But he has been there, off course.
Bonsoir.
Have you told someone?
Exactly.
Too far?
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
No one follows that midrash.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
What do you think you're doing?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Which is what?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Bigger and better.
Your father??
Where'd you get this?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
What's it about?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
That's a much easier game.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
How do you reconcile the two?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I thought you hated Torah.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How did you get the fucking number?
No!
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
What is happening?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Which one were you aiming at?
Shut up. Fuck you....
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
That's all we've got left.
Didn't you get anything?
Not too fast.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
When do you want it to go off?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Are you an artist?
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Do you think I...
Oh, fuck you...
You're going to live here permanently?
Does he know?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
You're leaving?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
What's happened??
No!
It can't be true!
The Italian, I presume?
I tell you she's mine!
Where did you two meet?
And just where are you from?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
The Mamma's there too.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Ten thousand.
Dollars.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
What about the shoes?
Enzo, wake up!
Where did you get that?
What's with the voice?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
That's good.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Good night.
What?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
That's good.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
You were right.
Don't you have a heater?
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
I'd better get back now.
How can you tell it's a female?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
You'll try again tomorrow?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Promise me one thing.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis!
In my apartment?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
... And those?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Please. Will you help me?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
What was that!?
You two know each other?
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
What's wrong with him?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
How do we bypass it?
What's your shpiel, Santa?
What are you doing?
What should I charge?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
So, how was I?
Get off of me you cripple!
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Is he in love with you?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Then what do you do?
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Cut.
The death card - -
See you tomorrow —-
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
You know Charlie How-Come?
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
That was unfortunate.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Makes no difference. Get him out!
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
Are you all right?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
That’s right.
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I found this at your brother’s.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
When did you get back?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
Something like that?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
To get me killed...?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
On the bed!
Who are you?
Where?
Where are the kids?
Where is it?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
What if it is?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Problems?
Am I supposed to know him?
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
Five to three. You’re early.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
I’m sorry...
It’s wet. Will this do?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
What’s the date?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Gluck.
Three...
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Are they still operative?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I would like some fresh straw.
Better today than tomorrow.
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
What did the king say?
Do as I say!
I'm already free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
No...
No, I... I held it up to...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
The English??
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
The voice was in your cell?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Please... may I have it back...
Thanks be to God.
... and what... what did he say?
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
... as always, majesty...
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
5,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Clear?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Yeah...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
We... won?!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Who... who are you...?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
God asked you to do something?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Yes I am.
But you already confessed this morning...
Only God knows the answer to that.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Someone you know?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
How are you doing?
Sit.
And how's Yurek?
When's your baby due?
For what? For my tie?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'm on the run!
Calm down, what, what is it?
Henryk's in there.
We're recruiting.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
That's better than yesterday.
It's not funny.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
How long have you been here?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Are the Russians here?
I don't know how to thank you.
What about you?
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Yes, why not.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
You the owner here?
Which way are the rooms?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'll take him anyway.
And?
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
You wanta wait for your share?
She coulda killed me last night.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
You done?
It isn't any better.
You got a back door to this place?
Looks like he missed ya.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
I don't even know you.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
So could Shaw.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
How are you?
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Then what are you hiding?
I don't believe it! You're lying!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Aren't you Nick Charles?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
There. 
I don't know.
It's been the same one for three months.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I know -- I know --
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
What about this Nunheim?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Get anything?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I said he hadn't written me.
I didn't know they had a fight.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
I think we may as well sit down.
Have a shot?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
You don't say --
It might.
I have no right to answer that.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Where's Gilbert?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Perfectly absurd.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
What am I?  The fall guy?
So it's you he was after!
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
You got types?
Where did you get that?
Good. I want to talk to you.
No.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
I'd like to see you work.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
You're a fine watch dog.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Who gave it to you?
Finished with these?
Hello... send him up.
Is that another Christmas present?
Sit down!
Why don't you?
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What things made you so sure?
Well, don't they?
How long has he been dead?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Is that true?
Trying to put it off on her?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
You his wife?
Was he a good detective?
Bonds, sir?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I'm sorry...  but...
Home?
Paper.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
What are we going to do!?
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Epps!
You ready?
You're the one with all the ideas.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
It's a combat action.
Then step aside.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
You think?
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Invest it.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They'll shoot us!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Steady it out!
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
You're not losing trust, are you?
They're doing more than slapping.
What are you doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
First Wes, now you?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sorry.
Wonder how the war's going?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
What do you make of them?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
People are suffering.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What does that mean?
He says it's a box.
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
If there's gold.  If!
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
I thought we were dead.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Think we can make it?
I can't hear him.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with....
Control ON.
You know I don't feel well.
I don't know.
I have to... he's a G-34
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What time is it?
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
They're watching us now.
THX!
What's going on....what are you doing?
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
Not very encouraging.
Where's LUH?
I'm leaving.
Right now.
...and you're not lost now?
How do you know?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I knew him.
She's not there
I'm sorry.
Yes
They're not here.
Coffee, Mike?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
So what were they doing here?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
Why do you do it?
Which one's which?
It's working.
Talk to me. Let's assess.
What's wrong?
What... ?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Right.
Political.
Jesus...
You okay?
Alex, please.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
It's our only option.
Yes.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Monescu.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Who?
The tennis player?
Please.
They're all right, aren't they?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Naturally I did.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
The same thing.
Then a little nap--
Beautiful.
Good night. 
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
No--yours, madame.
But attractive--
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Adolph J. Giron.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Goodbye...
It could have been marvelous ...
Lovely.
No, m'sieu!
Two lumps, madame?
About what?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Holy shit.
There's a satellite call for you.
I make my own luck.
An accident?!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
But I was with him the whole time.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
The boats are all going.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Jack, must you go?
I don't know the steps.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
You're trembling.
Now it's worse.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's getting quiet.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
It's been 84 years...
Don't come any closer.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Anya!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
What did you want a gun for?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
How about a little game later?
I'm so sorry!
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Tell me.
When?
A little.
Don't let's talk about it.
Who with?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Not a chance.
This is a business trip!
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Thank you, sir. 
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Here you are, sir. 
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Why--don't you like him?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Get that out of your trunk.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
What for?
Can you read 'em Jack?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
How much did you lose?
--you'd go with him!
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
Nothin'.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
God damn son of a...
Oh, my God...
What d'you think of the singer?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
Where'd you get that horse?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
Age quod agis.
On three?  You call it.
Here, Doc.
You don't even know him.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Very instructive
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
Praise Jesus!
Fun though, wasn't it?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
No, no, get away, get away from me...
I have to go.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Oh, all right.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
There they are.  No herd though.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Get down, boy.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
But -
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Do you feel better now?
What about the uranium?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
They point, I shoot.
I'll keep that in mind.
Do I have to do everything around here?
... Do you have a gun?
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Sometimes you just have to -
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
What do you make of all this?
Sakwa!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
I was an attorney!
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Damn. It's doing it again.
How is it now?
He brought that up from the wreck.
Is the helicopter ready?
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Oh, no.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
It was nip and tuck.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
What is that?
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Is this your house?
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Next stop...
Right here in the van.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
What are you doing over there?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
I could have stopped him.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Come on, this way!
Shhhhhhh!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Ha-ha!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh, that is disgusting.
I dunno.
I don't know!
No she's NOT --
MOM!!  MOM!!
Oh, no!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
No!  No, no, no, no!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
I'm red this time.
Woody!  Speed up!
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Stop it!
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Did you do this?
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
What?  What is it?
How much?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
How much do I pay him?
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
My Leica's gone.
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
How's David?
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
You do?  What else you do?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Arizona.
David --
They're going to walk right past me.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
We aren't barbarians.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You first.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
What's he doing up here?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I got money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Well, I've not brought them.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Great.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So, what's he like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Are you getting out much?
You take the test?
Now remember --
Exactly.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Running time?
Who wrote it?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
I can't believe you did that.
What was your price?
But you don't have the money?
That's tough.
Excellent.
Sounds great, Swanney.
There.
It's fresh air.
How's it going with Gail?
Six weeks!
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
No, no, it's not possible.
The ship....
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
But the shuttle-
This is the Starship Enterprise.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, Captain.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I do not often think of the past.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Is it possible?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
I believe I have found a faster way.
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... the booster rockets.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No special conditions?




And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
Why not?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Want one?
I want to go to his place.
Of what?
For what?
Flynn!
Beautiful!
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
You said it.
Meanwhile, he might find it.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
There's another beam!
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
So...how's the world of serious science?
A User?
You think we can make it there?
You've grown, big program.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
What is it?
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
That's not true, honey--
You seem fine now.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Harry!  Where are you!
What's this for?
Fourteen, Harry.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Helen's going to be pissed.
What's the plan?
There's another guy, still in the car.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Guy's a spook!
She could be telling the truth.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
He's got it.
So, it was your first time.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Yes.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Uh huh.
They said you had to run out.
Not because you were attracted to him?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
It makes you tell the truth?
Is it working yet?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
As much as you used to?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Yeeaoowww!!
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
You can trust me completely.
And you chased one?
You'll call me then?
To our assignment.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
How?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
Bye-bye.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Burt Reynolds.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
How long have you worked here?
You know when you sat behind me?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You have a pimp?
Is he black?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Yeah.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
This is Drexl's coke?
No. But thanks.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Don't you?
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
What do you want from me?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
What are you talkin' about?
That Vietnam movie?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
He knows.
He saw the wire.
What was I sayin'?
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Do you live here?
No.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Women will want to get to know you...
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
We're very close!  Because of you!
That's him.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
A jail?  Prison?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You used to call me "James".
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
We need gas.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
The gun! ... I lost it
I don't understand what we're doing.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
What does this mean to you?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
What...???
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
JOSE!
Jo...Jose????
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
But you know what's real now?
What...virus?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
He no!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Nothing.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
You want somethin'?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
How much!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
No!
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
You've been around.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Is it pretty?
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
John, please--
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
Let's do it here.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Well, nothing.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
John, throw me the keys.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Who the hell are you?
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Hey!
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Nice office you've got.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
What should I do?
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
Yeah, well, me too.
I came to kill her.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
Not from where I stand.
What are you babbling about?
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Got any cold soda?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Hell no!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Christ, I don't believe this!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
I'm a solid man.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Talk?  About what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
I need thirteen.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
Will he be back soon?
Accident.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
No! Okay! Okay!
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What you want?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Wasn't nothing.
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Did you ever?
Is that why you're with him?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Where?
In <u>cash</u>?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Grace ... Grace?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
I busted my leg!
Morning, officer.
"Arkady"
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
What'd you say to me!
Out of here.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Let me get your change.
Morning Grace.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Anybody hurt?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Is that the entire message?
What about Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
You've never been sick?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
It's for last week's game.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Yes.
I don't know what you're asking?
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
I'll just shoot him once.
In the passenger car?
Twelve years.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
You told them cowboys you had it.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
He said...
He's coming ain't he?
What'd he say?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Scouting?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Oh. Yeah.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Ned's share?
A sign on him?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe I ain't.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
About what?
Been gone near three years now.
Did you kill him?
Shit!
Yup.
Is it him?
That was... the first one.
Wha... what f-for?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He hit you?
HEY, KID.
Jesus.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Who's he?
Three.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
All that money... I mean... did you...?
K-k-kill somebody?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Well, suppose he does?
What was the money for?
I don't get it.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They want more time to think about investing.
Come home, Dean.
That's enough, Edie.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
He's alright.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
How do you do?
Get out.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
I was out of line.
Fenster and Hockney?
What if I
Ready?
Let's say for example -
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
We're on vacation.
A little of both.
What do you mean I can't see him?
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
I don't know about that.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
You're stalling, Verbal.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I knew him. He would never -
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
You're joking.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
How good's your intelligence?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
What are you doing here?
Say it.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Objection, we've...
What book is that?
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you ...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Listen to me, fella...
I can't guarantee that...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
I'm a lawyer.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
Why don't you get some rest?
Joe...  Joe...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Uh ...
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Been a long time, huh...?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
Are you with me...are you awake...?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
What the hell are you doing here?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... I'm sure you do ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I just saw her.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Yes.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Like all this.
Would you like a drink now?
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Will you have dinner with me?
Then will you for me?
Just dinner.
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Scottie, what are you doing?
Where shall we go for dinner?
Can't you see?
Scottie, why are we here?
I'm scared.
Love me... keep me safe...
Why am I here? What happened?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Oh... wandering about.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
One shouldn't live alone.
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
No.
Do you hear anything?
Why did you jump?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Don't leave me... stay with me...
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Her car is gone.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Could be.
I think I can lick it.
Step number two.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Yeah.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
I said how's it going?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why?
Don't point at me.
Don't even start.
What are you doing?
We have to call the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Sun rises at 5:52.
What is your problem?
Don't snap at them!
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
Nothing happened in Vegas.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
What?
She's not here.
Okay. Hi.
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Is everything okay?
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
What?
What's your point?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
I don't hate women.
False.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Are we supposed to?
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Can't we do it on the phone?
What do you mean, you think so?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
Charles Moore for instants.
He's weird.
He's a great chef.
How much?
Where are you?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
No way.
I know.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
He kept saying he was protected.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
So what do we do?
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Just kills me...
It means she's insecure.
I don't care for him.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
The post-Vegas Man.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
Give them to Refugio.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Where's the camera?
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Don Amalio!
Take me there.
What do you mean?
How did you know about that?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Let me pass!
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
How much is that?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
So, Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
You see how much you like her?
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Yes. Why?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
There's been an accident.
What's going on, Moncho?
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Don't talk like that!
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
Ask the priest, miss.
How do you feel?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Why would they be going there?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
I should have told him.
Think you can do it?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
I haven't been working on anything.
You need a maid.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Who said that?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Give me your wrist.
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
Find out anything?
That's why I'm asking.
Then shoot him already.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
...on the way in.
What about it?
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
...mmm?
Izzat the thing...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...where is the Back End coming from?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
You're tired, Ronnie.
...I just missed my plane.
...brazen-it-through...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
That's not bad at all.
Wilfred.
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
We're due at Andrews. 
My name is Ronald Brean.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
...Yes.
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Is there a press conference today?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
In the Folk Music Section.
Where is he now?
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
...a masterpiece...
Wake up.
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Show Must Go On.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
I have the White House on the Line.
I didn't ask for a dog.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Oh huh...
Why a beret?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
...mmm.
Oh, hell...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
... That's what you told us to say.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
...well, see him?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
The stock's going to Pluto!
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Another cup of coffee?
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
...thanks Natalie.
What if they call him?
I don't know anything!
So, where are we going?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Yeah, right...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
I guess I'll head back...
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
How you doing Buddy?
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I can't...and I won't.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
He did?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Yes?
Of course you will.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
What?
Fireball?
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Tell me.  I can help you.
That's not...It's not like that.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Would you like some iced tea?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Mrs. Frank?
What's your name?
I didn't sleep with him.
We were suite mates.
You are?
Jody--
Place your fingers on the planchette.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
I don't know.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Whatcha reading?
It's okay if you're not.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
It's just us now.
Maybe we should just...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Why?
Claire...
Hi.
Oh.
What are you doing here?
Think I may have cracked it.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Sorry.  You understand.
Where is she then?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
What are you doing?
What are you doing out here?
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Keep your voice down.
I'm sorry...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
We walked all night...
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's Madison Fra--
Ow!
That's not what I'm sayi--
What?
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
What?
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
My...mother...?
Who the hel1 -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
You're very clever, aren't you...?
There is no one here but the dead.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Harder...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Harder...
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Rowan...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
You know...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
You alright...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Something's wrong with you.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Her husband left her
Someday, I'll find out.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
You'll never believe who's in there.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Well?
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
You guys are my parents.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Finally, some gratitude.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Well?
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
My legacy.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Don't write that part.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
I see.
It's all so complicated.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
That's probably my office.
He's on the move?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Well? Surprised?
You promise you'll finish school?
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
I'm warning you.
You called the cops on us?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Merritt, Forensics.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Did you try to fight him?
How long?
I don't know what to say...
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
You saw the news today?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
If you want company...
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
About a year ago.
Why?
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
She bit you?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
What did you do then?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
A ride.  You want one?
It's those rocks, up there.
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
He... Sam Lombardo?
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Hello?
I'm running away.
Good thinking.
Who is it?
Where is she?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
But I..
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry?
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
You feeling all right?
Now, what was that?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Know what this is?
This is good.
No record of him.
Willard...
What is that?
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
My God!  He's so excessive!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He calls it the Tarantula.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
You're not that big.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
I beg your pardon?
When are they coming?
Hey...!
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I can't.
I can't.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
You!!
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Did she ask about me?
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
What do you want!
How am I gonna do that?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Tir Asleen.
How??
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Are you sure?
Get back here, Rool!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Madmartigan.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Nail it!
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Is it them?
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
But not a good tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why?
How long?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Your husband's?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
But Stoltzfus said...
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
That's God's way!
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Everything okay?
John said you're Amish.
What's so funny?
Who was that man?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I will be the judge of that.
He's not in this building.
Is this where we're going?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Uhh -- yeah --
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Our echo.
...have you come back?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Run, Toto, run!
Toto's my dog.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, now?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Oh --
Aw, come, come, come --
That's our farm!
Oh --
...room --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oil can.....Oil can....
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
We might.
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, my!
...has been simply unbearable.
Who's her?  Who's her?
I'll be home in time for supper!
Because I'm still scared!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh -- Oh --
...ting the ruby slippers?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
...Tin Man!
...of the West.
No, sir!
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Hey, Dorothy!
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
Stop that dog!
Zukovsky...
He’s sealed himself in.
Do you know what you’re doing?
We’ve got to get out.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
It’s just a scratch.
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Consider me ungrateful.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
He was my father.
Does this look familiar to you?
Oh my God...we’re buried alive...
I can’t stay here.
Then take me with you.
...what?
Where’s M?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
I thought you were the one in her business.
The Maiden’s Tower.
No! Bond!
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
The parcel’s in the post.
Why?  What's the problem?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
What's your theory?
I'm here, Laurie.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
What??
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
. . . What?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
What?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
. . . That was quick.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What new information?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Thanks.
Whatchu doing here?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Where are you going?
Hey, you're good.
What are you?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
What's that?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Where's he headed?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Toadies right behind.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
What are you doing?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
What's this?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
Scott.. I -
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
Dr. Grey.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Where am I?
He helped you?
What did she do to me?
I felt like she almost killed me.
Is that so?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Carlson!
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
What?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Surprised?
Love me?
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Dr. Frankenstein?
What?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
The wockers with the knockers.
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
It's always been one of my favorite names.
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Original.
Yes.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Where is he?
What monster?
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Do you think you can sing it?
All right -- give it to him!
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I will.
MMMMmmmmm!
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Three minutes to go!
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Do you have a reservation?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
