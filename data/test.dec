Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
I was?
Then that's all you had to say.
You always been this selfish?
What crap?
I did.
Queen Harry?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Like you care.
What?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
Exactly my point
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Dead at forty-one.
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
Sure
Away.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
A deal's a deal.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Block E?
Who cares?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Funny, you're the only one
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Sure, I do
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Who?
I hate him.
Maybe.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Fallacy.
You know what I mean
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
What?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Because I like to torture you.
I thought you were punishing me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Pirate -- no question.
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Excellency, you are right.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I don't want you to wait for me.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Call them.
Look out of that window.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
What did they say about Granada before today?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You will regret this.
God be with us admiral.
And what do you think Mendez?
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
You bring the cigarettes?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
They won't until this is over.
Somewhere else?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
They're not gonna send you right back.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
End my career?
Yeah.
Vodka tonic.
When?
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Describe him.
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
This isn't homicide school.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Better than one.
Of course.
My point exactly.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Could be Leon's.
Yeah.  I promise.
Don't be late.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I'm not moody.
Not what.  Who.
That's unique.
No.  Are you proposing?
How long are you planning to stay?
Okay.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Cut!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
I want to hear everything he said.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I used an accelerant.
Oh yeah, why?
He knew all along.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Sure, what is it?
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes.
He's got a point.
Yes, I know.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, what is it?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I will if I can, Frank.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Whaddya mean, buy?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
No chance.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
You have a good time?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Must be billy's girl.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
I'm heading out. How about you?
You're hopeless.
What'd you do?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
So what?
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
That's what I always say.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Can't complain.
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
First, the money.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Give it back.
Napoleon... small.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
No thank you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You noticed...
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
And then?
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
They are... with me...
I was talking to the cat.
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Vito Cornelius?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
...Leeloo.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
I'll be right back.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
I thought you were divorced.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
What is... Make Love?
Apipoussan!
...Hoppi-hoppa.
...The rain falls...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Actually only one cell survived..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Recommendations.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Why the gun?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
What you see is what I got, mister.
I'd rather you didn't.
Where are the women?
Look, I don't know what this...
Call me Tom.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
I'm not so sure about this.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
Eddie.
I told you, I don't know.
Yeah.
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Show me.
Stop talking.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'll risk it.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Sounds good, pops.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Interesting theory.
Snuff films.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
No.
I'm telling you it's not that.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
How will I get it to you?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Neil... Neil Cole.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I don't know.
Yes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I don't know.  I think so.
Will you let me look?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Who is this... ?
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
I can't find him.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Sounds like a game show host to me.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
You're his sister, right?
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Huh?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Me too.
Since my little girl became a mom...
But Dad --
Why don't you two stick to reality.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Yeah...
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
I'd sooner swim!
Yes?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Huh?
I guess.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Listen!  Hear that?
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Somewhere down there?
Oh it does???
Seems to be all around...
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Something wrong?
What about time...?
Under <u>water</u>?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
That's what I said!
What?
Nothing we can do, now.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
- for horrors like yourself?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
All right - go to it.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
What happened?
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
In the chest.
What blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I called Mommy.
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
What are you sorry for?
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
I figured you already heard.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Where's Jill?
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean that.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
But not now.
What way?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
She's coming.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Wade?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Well, I never heard that one.
For what?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
I'm sorry, honey.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
You read my mind.
Stay cool.
I prefered the terrorists.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Ga get it.
Nine.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Where are we now?
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
What do you want with us?
Yes
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Good. Good.
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Hold on, Alice.
Yes, sir.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Both of you.
But...
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Commissioner.
Te...!
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Simon.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
I think so.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Maybe.
Go ahead.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Sure.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Then Elaine was right.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Certainly.
Well...
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
What is it?
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I will, but Jim won't.
Huh?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
That's right.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
I am George.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Did you talk to him?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
At the end of the bar.
Uh, Matthew...
Your mother mates out of season.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
To the... to the beach?
Thank you.
Nothing.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We all did.
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
I can't!  Do you mind!
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
How long until it blows?
See you soon.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
She's right.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
It's insured.
I don't know.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
About seventeen days.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
No.. I've slept enough.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Where is she?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Newt, wait!
That's right.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
A Turkish brothel.
Well, what does it matter to you?
Extremely clever.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Sir -
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I want to go!
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
What?
Eat my - ah!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Tell them to go!
Oh, damn!
Wolfi.
Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
No one.
I'm not telling you.
You'd think I was mad.
I can't write it!
It's killing me.
He's terribly busy, sir.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Oh, yes.
Behold!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
Ah-ha!
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Enchanted, Madame.
Ah! By all means.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Well. There it is.
How is your financial situation?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Mine?
No one calls you that.
Bene.
Really? What is it he's writing?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What is this?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
How could I not?
Who are you?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! No, it's him!
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Of course.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Yes.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes.
I'm not leaving you.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Yes.
I've seen the manuscript.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Did we?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
I can't wait.
What do you mean - now?
I agree, Baron.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
The American? Yes, duck.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Will you give me a break?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Will you come with me?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Your dead friend Jack?
Very nice.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
What?
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Will you shut up!?!!
David, let's go now.
Chart says he's from New York.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
I was having a nightmare.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
David.
She's a jerk.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Shall we?
It's a five-pointed star.
You ask them.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Pecos Bill.
I don't know. Come on.
Plan?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Are you going to help me up?
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What?!
I wanted to see you.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
You don't have to say anything.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
No.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
And what, Sergeant?
Yeah.
How much?
Yeah?
Aw, nerts!
Yes, sir.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
Get out, get out!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
You don't have to do nothing.
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
I want to be near you!
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
What are you doing here?
Now?
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Yes, thank you.
Why, I don't know.
Yes, sir.
You're protecting somebody.
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Is it safe?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Oh, is that so?
With what?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Mr. Williams . . .
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
I don't know.
Yes.
Then where were you?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
That was two hours ago.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
How?
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Two.
Exactly.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
What?
Tell me.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
What's going on?
What is wrong with you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Twenty?!
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Missed you too, cousin.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You ride like a Comanche.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Both would be nice.
Strategically.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
My little Web did that?
Died a hero.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Got any ideas, little brother?
Jim was old enough...
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
Yeah Jimmy?
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Last February?
I think so.
I swear.
You do that.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
THEN WHO DID?!
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Sir?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It is a nice piece of writing.
Can't you tell me anything?
No.
Vengeance.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Is it a what?
I never knew you smoked.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
You just haven't been looking.
Do...what.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Everybody has a great body now.
It's not.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Yes, naturally.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
What?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Leaving what?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Hmmmm.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
What do you think I do?
No. Flattering, but no.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Next Saturday?
Why would I?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
No, I'm okay.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
No, he just hung out there.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
We were both seven in 1969.
No.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Not a big music fan, eh?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm so hungry.
What am I gonna do?
Al.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
'Gonna wait outside.
We're not gonna let it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Yes sir.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
I do!
...Do I?
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Just do it.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Where we going?
You're famous around here.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
No. Please.
Why would you do a thing like --
Certainly not at my happy home.
What?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
But you said the other --
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Speaking of which...
I could get it out of him.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Or sometimes not at all.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Thank you, Exposition.
Thanks.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
What?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Why not? It's a question.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
Sure.
What?
I'm sure.
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm sorry.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Not now, Austin.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
No need. I'll call again.
Love...
... preserve...
Three days.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Eh? In here!
Hmmm ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
We want to help...!
Too many cooks --
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
What are my choices?
Mother?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
Any other vices?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
No trouble.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Where are you going?
But --
Decontamination -- ?
Peter's brother?  But --
I know all this.
... and now?
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Global warming?
How did you guess?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Anyone particular in mind?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
Where?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
She was ...
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
That's not playing by the rules.
Did I? My mistake.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
I want Debbie.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What is this person's story here?
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The car for Debbie?
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes I did.
But how can I do that?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Yes, sir.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
About what?
Good...
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I am committed. I love you.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Great, Mom.
Any time, Al.
Let's see your bread.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Let's have a toast.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
You're a pimp?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
C'mon. I insist.
Still drawing a blank.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
He's alive.
Not likely.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Thanks for the insight.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
You're selling dad's boat?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Well, you did invite me here.
Just take it.
Hey, do I know you?
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
But the right guess on this is arson.
What?
But he killed these guys.
Are you going public with this?
Yeah? Airtight?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Like it never happened...
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Management were pin heads.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Here we go...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I need that report, Lt.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Why?
Nah...
Who?
You mean you could use it.
I'm a Catholic.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Let's go NIGGERS.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
What do I do?
I'm a revolutionary.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Must be the pressure.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Pleased to meet you.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Where do you go from here?
Is that so?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Which one is your brother?
Break a leg.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Please don't go there.
That's why it will be so much fun.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
You sound like the media.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...too early...
...like grits and butter...
You slept too near where you got in?
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Just a little something' somethin'.
No, before my time.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
My people love me.
Y'know what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Say what, Manray?
Why don't you answer?
You can go now.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
How do you do, sir?
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Yes, sir.
Only the agency of servants.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Have you had one?
Have you not a man whom you value?
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
It is my only object.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Old fool!
Then you must get it.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
I see.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, papa.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
HEY!
It's... too slow.
They're dead, aren't they?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
That son of a bitch.
I didn't shoot West --
Yeah --
And the bodies?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
How do you know that?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
I...
We just want to check your pack --
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
My heart weeps.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
Well?
Because I was standing next to him.
I don't know --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
That's horseshit and you know it.
You're drunk --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Good cop/bad cop?
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
The very same.
I plan to grow on you.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Good idea.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
Good, just making sure.
Tough.
Think it'll work?
I should probably write that down.
The faggot speaks.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Fifty minutes.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
Childs.
What the fuck are you doing?
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
No --
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Who is she? Where does she live?
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
Fine, I will.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Please?
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Okay.
Make him stop.
Am I?
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You think I'm fake.
Like this.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
They're your favorite flower.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
There is no softer ground than town.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I'm robbing this place.
'Fraid so.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm, what?
You're not.
We rented a car.
Yes.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
No I don't.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
There's over eighty thousand here.
Do you want to stop?
It is. I did it cooking.
Thank you.
Ch...
Right.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
What are you doing here?
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
He wants money.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
I know you just want to punish me --
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Have you got your passport?
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
But, you know, so what?
And. It's wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes neither.
Why?
You didn't mind too much.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
What was her name?
It's more like a date.
Yes, ma'am.
You take her to a doctor?
This gonna get you in trouble?
That'd be nice.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
I need ya help again.
You gonna miss your bus.
Yeah.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You been home yet?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
I got others.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Yeah.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Better'n me?
Rose... please...
LAZ, I said let...!
Why you got me chained?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Uh-uh.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
We drinkin' buddies now?
I ain't in a hurry.
Anything.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Huh?
This Rae... you get with her?
Now, hold up.
What'chu sayin'?
Uh-huh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You could put it that way.
Rae...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Thought you had a man for that.
Thanks.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
I didn't know.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What'd she say?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
There she is!
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
You were too far behind.
Shut-up.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
I don't know.
We can't lose.
There was a change in plans.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
He drinks.
I don't remember you saying no.
Tell them I'm not.
Then take it from him.
Yeah.
Look.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Then go get him.
Why?
Of course not.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Garbage man?
Yeah.  I got it.
Your customer, eh?
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.

Prosit.
Four years.
I'm doing okay.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Huh huh.
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What night?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
For holes.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Sorry.
Why should I be?
I work alone.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Hmmm?
Because it's not.
Go ahead.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
But how come I'd be there?
Hi.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
What?!
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Do ya?
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
You don't?
Get away from me!!
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
My Mom and Dad.
What?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Name it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
The big one!
That's what I was afraid of.
The engine is still running.
I like it.
Good for you.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
So, what are you seeing?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Good-bye!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Goodnight!
Yes, sir.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Tempus fugit!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Your mom made that all by herself.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Shit is a French word?
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh, I think they have.
You nut!
And it's called...?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Juneau.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
No.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
So, did you buy a movie?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Yeah...Seems to.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
Thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Yes, ma'am.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
No.
What?
Honey?
What shall we call him?
Yes.  Well... yes.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Hi.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Just open the door.
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
--and we will--
--do as I say!
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
We did not leave together.
Yes, you do!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Fallout shelter.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Roger, Wolf One.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Yes.
Okay.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yeah.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Who's it, you mean.
Don? Are you in with them?
I'm doing it.
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
Just get outta my bed.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Don? Where is he?
Mommy's here.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Then, shut up!
If you want to.
No thanks. What does that mean?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Nothing.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Yeah. okay.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Am I bothering you?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You look beautiful.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Dorothy Vallens?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Okay.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Italian.
No pictures, either.
For what?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
A bit.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Yes.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
He's a good man.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Of course they were. How many?
It was... It was...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
We promise.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
This is some crazy shit, man!
You feel?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
What do you want me to say?
Just go!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
The... The funny man.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
No. This is he.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, I heard that.
Yeah.
You think we're going to be chased?
Where's the other stocker?
Like he meant it.
I don't want to use it.
I keep it for emergencies.
I'll say it.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Yes... It's true.
We said 48 hours.
If you say so.
Can you hand me those french fries.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
That's not correct.
I know.
She needed it.
Shut up!
Who's Mr. Henry?
Bob!
Eleven fifteen.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Hang on a second.
Any activity?
It's going back down.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Kumar.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.
I'm not kidding.
How?
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Grammar.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Yes, he did.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
No. Bob did.
Yeah.
Why'd you want to help us?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Temporarily.
No.
You're Anthony?
Uh-uh.
That's your friend Anthony?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
I warned you, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
That's your domain.
His name was Swifty?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
It's registered in my mother's name.
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
I don't know.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Not bad.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
I'm trying.
Yes.
Well, I think --
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
Mr. Henry?
And the Landy woman?
I want to know about Treadstone.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Don't you want answers?
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Thanks.
Keep going...
Lots of people...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
I speak English.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No, I do.
Yes...
You're a liar.
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
Conklin.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
But it ends up the same.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
You do?
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
I want to come in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Sounds like a threat.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Is there. Is all there.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
If you say so.
You mean, did I want a date?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
By who?
And what about you, anything?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We cannot defeat this --
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
He will. I know he will.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
That depends on the man.
I will not.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
It matters not, he is thy king!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
...Tonight!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
Exactly.
So what did you find.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
My father has a bad memory, too?
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
What? What could he do?
Cute, Evan.
Fix?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Yes.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
You'll see.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Evan Treborn.
Deal. Now read me something.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Huh?
I'm sorry.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yes?
My husband is with me, too.
No.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, Monsieur.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
Come up here a minute.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, sir.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
Suppose we do.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Practically no one.
And the carrying charges?
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Yes, something.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
What are they?
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Looking for a job.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
It doesn't matter.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Please.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
No, not yet.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
We'll discuss it later.
He suggested I ask you.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
What for?
Not at all.
Go ahead.
My office.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I said, ask your wife.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
-- Thank you.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
A leader, like Laszlo?
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Perhaps not.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Yeah? What's his name?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Why two?
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
-- Thanks. I will.
Yeah? Why?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Put that gun down.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
You think of everything, don't you?
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
No.
Good. Then have a drink.
Yeah, boss?
No, I don't.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Take it.
Survive today, that's the point.
No!
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
You are.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Not if you work for FedEx.
He's your cute thing.
For when I travel?
Could you watch Jango?
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
Yeah?
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
So did I.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
I'm doing fine.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What about the sender?
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
We're on.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
It's me.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Time I had lots of.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Deep, real deep.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
San Francisco.  And you?
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
They just want you to hire some new help.
You cook very well!
I doubt it. She's just an...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Really?
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Hi...
I never said they were boring.
Well, they aren't.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
She looks after other people's children.
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
His father's dead, right?
I don't remember.
Really! Is it serious?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Actually, I volunteered.
Migrants?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Right.
Is it true?
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
I haven't read that.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Of course.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
It's just my heart.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
It look nicer then home!
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
You sure?
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I can't do that.
Because you killed one of my crew.
I need you to stake me.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
I think I just broke my hand.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Sure.
You get an equal cut.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Then show me how.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
WHAT?
Glenn talked you out of it.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
What do you want? An apology?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Miles...
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Good point.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
You sure?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Keep it up.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
A little bit of both.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
That's it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Roger that.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Goodnight.
I can imagine.
I despise the job.
A couple I know are getting married.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I'm working on that soccer story.
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
South African women are very sporty.
Not particularly.
You mean I won't resist them.
You want me drunk?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
You will?
Never. Why do you ask?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
So why did you come to my casino?
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
I don't gamble.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You choose.
Then you're not a pro.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Yes.
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who...
And what do you do, Lucy?
You've done pretty well.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
That bitch? No.
No thanks.
I don't gamble.
Rough life, Jack.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I said good call.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
I think he's talking to it.
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Doolittle, are you there?
Time to start talking.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
-- open quantum latches --
Energy shielding positive function.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Huh?
Hello, bomb.
Hey, bomb.
And I saw that I was alone.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Hmmm...
I have no proof that it was false data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Yes, Doolittle.
What?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
Ah, negative drop.
-- Remark.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Well, what you might try is --
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
I'm on a break.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You mean until you showed up?
She was there...
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Police drone.
I ain't mad at you...
I got overhead...
Yech...
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Hello...
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Logan Cale.
Too early to tell.
Lauren's not my wife.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
It was open.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
No, I meant this.
The other ones?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Your help.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
Any idea when she'll be back?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Here's your money.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
You're crazy.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
They're prisoners to their genes.
I actually know how this works.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
You get it when I get her.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
But I'll take a rain check...
Max--
I'm the victim here.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
How'd you get her out of town?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
I was on call. 
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Hawk.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Right, slow...
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Yeah.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
The paint!
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hawk?
What's gone?
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
A bustier?
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
The KISS Army!
Not if I shoot first!
Good morning...
GOOD MORNING!
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
So... that's it?
Like a spear.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
What did you say?
You'll know soon enough.
We went to a hotel.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Sure.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Will you go with me?
Why?
What?
Maybe she's asleep.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What's wrong with you?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
No.  That's stupid.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
But you were punished.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
You're not a bitch.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
It is a big deal.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
This came for you, sweetie.
Your parents'd kill you.
Huh?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
What?!
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Hi.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
You could be quiet.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
All right, they're makin' a movie.
I got a hairdo.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Gladys! Stop it!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Nothin' too showy!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
Harold!
"My dear"...
Is that all?
But you're my father -
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
I don't call him, I whistle.
He only weighs ten ounces --
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
You told it to me.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
Yes.
No... it was a seven letter word.
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Why -- why -- of course.
Oh, would you...?
Yes please, two.
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
And here are my mother and father.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
That I am very little different from him.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I intend to.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Yes sir.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
You've never been?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
John Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
You did not ask me.
Of course! What did you think?
Good morning.
I thought as much.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Yes, very soon.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Ah! It's my father!
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But, Father, it IS!
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
It was different...
I've never been to bed with anybody!
And I thought you said it was something special...
And the week before that?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
Of course.
I... but I...
Yes -- I believe you do.
Not quite...
I see the world.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
About raping me?
Why... should YOU care?
Well... no...
No.
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
ROW!
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
To the oars!
I've got you!
What is it?
I will join my grandfather there.
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
What do we have to do?
Do what?
Got you!
I... I...
Can't make enough swords!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
You went berserk...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Stop it!
Helpless...
You liar!
No, Mother.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm not nuts.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
No, I'm okay for now.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Yeah.
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
It's three.
Would you get me another, Joely?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Naomi, I guess.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Hi.
Okay.
I think she's great.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
What if?
Joel, come here. Please.
Oh, um...
I'm nervous, too.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Oddly enough, I do.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Your dried cum.
Hi.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
I'm like a joke to them.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
You have to stop this!
You take it. I don't know.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Yeah. Cool.
Hi.
Sorry. I just --
I know. Anyway --
'kay.
It's a good one all right.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Well, what should we do?
Do you swear you didn't know?
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
He went home sick.
She came to help, Howard.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Just wanted to let you know.
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we need to focus.
Jesus, Patrick!
The Clock People?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Easy come, easy go.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I have to go, Julian.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Yep.
I'm the best.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Justin?
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
What about the accumulator...?
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
No, he didn't.
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
Trauma.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
He's crashing...
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Starck!
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Yes, sir!
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
...you okay?
Do it.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The date.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
You can't, your orders are specific...
Watch me.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
Yes, sir.
Where is it?
Starck...
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Blow it up?
No. I'll be right back.
He's been past Mars?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Oh, he did.
Victor must've taken him.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I already got it. Everything I want.
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
He's made a few changes.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
What about you?
Ben, are you there?
I can go hotter!
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
We need to get past them.
That's what we're here to find out.
You were?
Why didn't you say something?
Not at all.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Just find him.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Arnold. What's happening?
You want to work at Carl's?
Later.
No. I want my money back right now.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Sis.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Your friends use the pool too.
Well... it's true.
I didn't say that.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Okay, Dennis.
Ugh.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Nice to meet you.
Oh, really?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I didn't see you this morning.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Yeah?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
All right. Pay attention.
Damone. It's Mark.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
How often do you go?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
I thought he was out of town.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
What variables?
There's nothing to it.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
What?
That little prick.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
What do you want?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yeah, like maybe never.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
All right! Oh, yeah!
No problem.
The point sounds fine.
Yes.
I've heard that, too.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Righto!
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Not where we operate.
Dobermans don't talk.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
A major!
Las Vegas.
What?
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Lacerda?
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
Why what?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GO?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
They were all veterans.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
Never missed a plane yet.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
We're going to get my little girl.
Gonna stay for a couple?
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
OPEN THE DOOR!
There's a tunnel.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Shit!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Fuck you too.
What?
Just an observation.
Why don't you go check it out?
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
What?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Okay then.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
What?
He shot you the other time.
Nothing.
Seven.
Whoa!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
What?
Move slow and move quiet.
YOU'LL HIT US!
That's fine.
Wait God-dammit!
GO-GO-GO!!
All right.
Oh...
I'll do anything to help.
Deal.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Thank you --
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
I'd like nothing better.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I'm not!
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
GET OUT!
Claire?
...Yes.
What night?
You want his name?
I gotta go now.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
But I'll never win that.
Really?
He's a socialist, then?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
And you think it's worth all this?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Always. Always.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Fifteen.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Yeah, well --
You think I'd miss it?
...So you think I should go.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Kaminski.
Eight stories.
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Calm down, Frances.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
What?
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Yeah. I don't know.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
You're taking me home!
You kill me, Mama.
Go on...
Where are you going?
Yes, Mama.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
Oh bullshit.
It ain't for lack of trying.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Then why weep for him?
Kill me and have done with it.
I don't know.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
And you look so lovely.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Nothing can. Not ever.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Not as weak as I.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
As a march hare.
Can you think of a better reason?
Is that your diagnosis?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
No. They don't.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Thanks, Alice.
Un-hunh.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
They're off now.
Marcie?
Wet. I don't know.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I can't, Barry...
Somebody'll see.
I need you so much, Claudette.
For sure.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Is it stuck?
I don't believe you...
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Good call.
I love you.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Umhummmmph.
Whassamatta?
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
Have you ever been there before?
I have no idea.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
On the dresser.
Sorry, I need everybody.
Scott and Kate.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Pass.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
In the Winnebago.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
No!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Where are you taking us?
What you said to me in the room.
Yes.
Okay.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Not many.
Me too.
Later.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Whatsamatter?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
You can't come in here.
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
No.
How do you know?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Yes.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I did?
Really?
What?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Yeah, it's mine.
Thank you, ensign.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Thank you, sir.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
No problem, sir!
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
'Snot me.  It's him.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Get it up!
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Well, now I feel so much better.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
That's a good story.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
Educate her, Pyro.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
That's not right.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
So am I.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The first female President?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
We know, Audrey.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
No.
Yeah, well...
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Are you sure?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Nesting?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
That's the problem. He did.
Not now. You got my bag?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Allez, allez!
Have them sealed off.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
But you don't know for sure!
You don't have the authority to do that.
Oh.
Makes us look more American.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Is that the bathroom?
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Could they be the miners?
Nobody was WATCHING?
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Yes?
We need another one.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Never mind, Fred....
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
It's ... incredible.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
JASON...
I don't think that's a cloud...
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Computer, can it be repaired?
Don't be ridiculous.
It helps.
Turn on the translation circuit.
Gwen...
Mark 12.
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Closer?  I can try.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
Simpler.
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
But there it is!...
But... Inside, I have seen-
But...Why?
And determination.
Okay, let's go.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
And a French alliance?
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
It is.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
To learn to shoot cannon?
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
To hell with Arnold...
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
You invented this, this...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
What's the difference?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
I... they look both the same.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
I want you to see our hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I'd throw everything away for you.
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Let's get you darker!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
Come here, Farrah...
Farrah. Come here.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
So you didn't have the key with you.
You spotted them, huh?
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
So... how many movies you been in?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
That's right, me.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
What money?
What?
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
I can't do it.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Okay. So who are you?
Who?
That's correct. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Yeah? Which terminal?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm a producer.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Where you been, Harry?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I know what a marker is.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
But you work for the casino?
Harry, look at me.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
So what's the problem?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
His shrink's trainer.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
One of mine?
That's not bad.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Buddy?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I'm up twelve grand today.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
You broke in?
What if it was?
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Right. See how your story ends.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I want to know.
What happened?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
You're as bad as Harry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
That's what the guy said.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I'm thinking about producing.
That's where you got the idea?
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
What money?
Hello, Martin.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
Thanks.
Morning, skipper.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
A what?
Right. Wednesday.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Yeah, yeah.
Hard to say.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
I don't know what you're talking about?
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
If money can buy what he wants.
Right.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
You're more practical than superstitious.
There's somebody else on this boat.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
No cowboy shit. Right.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
But, who -- ?
Doesn't matter.
Not our mystery guest again.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Right here.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
We hit land.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
Go.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
How's that?
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
You're up late.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Shut up.
Better late than never.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
YES.
Not the Maxine?
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
So what do you think?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Then why do you hate me so much?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Why?
How perfect.
Good.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Why do I always have to do it?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Bingo!
Gross!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Forget it, I can't explain it...
What are you talking about?
Let's go hassle Josh.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Go ahead...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
You're insane.
I said "great"...
I need to talk to you.
That's all you're bringing?
What time?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Shhh!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Where did you get those pants?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Good luck...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
PLEASE? We have to!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
What are you, a fry cook or something?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
That's the spirit!
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Who knows?
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
So, do you like me, Seymour?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
I wish I could see him.
She's not at home?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
On that pathetic fake blind date.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Don't they, though?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
What if there are complications?-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
What happened to them?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Since his beard was red.
Once... 
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
We don't have a relationship.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Does he ever mention me?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
What are you doing up here?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
The Upper West Side.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
-- the sorrow --
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Do I?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
No, I just thought --
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
No.  They're just coming to me.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
What?
I told you, I ...
Goodbye.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Talk to my accountant. 
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I think it's the food of the future.
Thank you.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
A square?
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
I'm always serious.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Why not?
She said he was "the Destructor."
Life is just a state of mind.
I blame myself.
Neutronize.  System shut.
That appears to be the case.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
You're coming back?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What are you talking about?
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
I'm serious.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I don't know...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
Only from a distance.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Yes.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No.
Wait a minute.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
No.
You sure you really want to?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Here? In Berkeley?
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Because -- I am.
What do you think?
Elaine -- I love you.
What did she say?
Then what?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Yes.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
It's in the main ballroom.
Oh no.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Is what a girl?
No. 
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
What's wrong?
Well I don't know.
So?
Sit down.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Why is it?
Where is it?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I've got to go.
Of course.
Waiter!
Well -- do you want to go up first?
The number.
Benjamin.
INADEQUATE!
How about art.
No.
No.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Are you shocked?
Not particularly.
Kind of.
What?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Why not?
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
I was just kidding around.
Let's drop it.
You're not.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
You don't have to say that.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Go home now.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
No -- they don't.
About what?
To be what?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No. She doesn't know about it.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
I'd like to hear it.
I will.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
I'd like to discuss this.
Dad -- can you listen --
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
With the pearls?
Not with strangers.
Who?
Oh -- work!!
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Where downstairs?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
What do you want here?
Because you love me -- you love me?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I don't want them now.
Yes.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
Why do you think --
Bless you --
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
We could come to my room.
You've lost everything?
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
Be quiet.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
You're tired. I can see that.
The Grand Hotel.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Everything?
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Yes --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
What?
Oh yes, of course.
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Moreover --
Moreover...
I got ten marks for that.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Well?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
I wish to be alone.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
What's that, Lilly?
Goody!
So here we are!
We're not really interested, Henry.
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
What? He's going to be all right!
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
Hello.
So I heard.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Only one tooth?
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
What?
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Always, for you, baby.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
You called the doctor, huh?
You ain't seen nothin.
The long end. Big con.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Open your door.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I'm happy the way I am.
Gun?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Only the real stiffs.
Charming.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
I think someone broke into my house.
You're so predictable.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Forget it.
Nothing.
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
No.
John, you can't help her now.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Looks great.  It does.
What?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
I can't believe this is happening.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I did alright.
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Where's Shane?
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Then they can watch.
Danny!!!
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
But surely Rogers isn't --
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
I'll meet you over there.
Jamie's baby ...
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
No one.
You know what gets me?
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Must have changed that law.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
The hell with the diamonds!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Let's talk about it some other time.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I dunno.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I dunno.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I forget mine for years on end.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
For what?
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!  Out!
As a matter of fact--
Dr. Woodly.
He worships Father.
What's good about that?
Tell me that.
Mhravitch.
Go on.
They're not engaged.
Sir?
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Penelope!
Damn.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
It's your house, Dad.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Heaven.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Situation.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I did?
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
I have a brain.
Ram it up your ass!
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
What are you going to do?
No you're not!
Sneaking in the back door.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Hope.
Almost a Christmas scene.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
What a handsome word.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Don't!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Out!
You've killed women?
He's dead, you know.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
I've never heard of it.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
King Arthur.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
There was so much going on.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ja?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Stay home tonight!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No.
Don't know.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
He can hardly talk.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He is my father.
How long has this been going on?
Marry me instead.
Take plenty of cigars.
Tonight's the night.
Why would you do that?
Paul's only twelve years old.
He's not your son.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Penelope!  We're late!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
How many weeks?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Um-hm. Live sound.
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
Ulcers.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
But it's all you do.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Fuck.
No, please go on.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
But then you'll forget about me.
That's right.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Where is she?
No.
They are?
What do you mean?
What's it called?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out!
Like what?
Does she know anything about this?
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What plan?
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
You never heard of that?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Oh.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Oh, I don't have one.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Out!
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Your hearse?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
That's really great.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Because they are all the same.
Well...
But this is public property.
Is he all right?
Well, I don't...
But I don't play anything.
Superb.
I don't know.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Where's that?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Maude.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
At a funeral.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Like a tea ceremony?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Does that worry you?
Why?
Ah, yes.
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I don't know.
No.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
ZAT!
Souvenirs?
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Yes!
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
What's the matter with her?
If anyone can help, HE can.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Finish what?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
Is he serious??
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Red, I found something --
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
I knew those men better than you did --
You call that thing a cigar??
No. I never was.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Marco...
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
A brute.
What -- ?
What's the problem?
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Hi.
It'll go in.
Julia's my second wife.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
I don't remember.
No.
This isn't happening.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Who are you?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
What kind of doors?
Who did?
So you were cheated.
Maybe.
Which is where?
I was here this afternoon.
Like who?
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
No. I'm not.
Why not?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I'm here.
Kirsty.
No. I'll do it.
Don't go upstairs.
Please. I can't bear it...
That depends.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
YOU'D like my room.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
O.K.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I've forgotten.
I love you, honey.
Yes!
What's the problem?
No. It's all over.
We walk.
She's so damn... English.
Your father told me you were working here.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
What's next?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
How do you know about that?
Haven't seen it.
No way.
So?  You even said they're good.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're getting that anyway.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
No, you can't.
I have all of the others.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
So.  Is now a good time?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
What do you mean, four more?
Fine.  That's great.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Can I help you?
I understand, Dick.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
I should be so lucky.
I think you know that.
Just the obvious stuff.
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
It's me.
Those aren't mine.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Well, think about it.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Pigsty.
Pig died.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Yes, of course.
C'mon.
Hi.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
You're being stupid.
Wanna go to dinner?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Are you persuadable?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Well she --
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Naw.  Those are for us.
No, we...
Sure.
Claymore.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
I've been to Church Hill.
Where?
Have you gone to the police?
No one knows you're here?
You're a fool.
Not all of them.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
It's beautiful.
Follow me.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
I see.
Come here, Brenna.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
The inheritance.
It'll never stick.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
It's that important?
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
Yes.  Always.
It is less.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
You are still so very young.
Not even a single lifetime.
No!
You will live.  Survive.
Me arm hurts.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I feel hardly nothing.
But why be so concerned about me?
I am not ready for this.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
What would you like?
Like you.
Certainly not me.
Romirez is dust.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Mulet.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
It can be different.  It must be.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
I don't know.
Kahn?
Sit.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
Leave her out of this.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Are you here?
No.
Your murder weapon?
We were very close.
I'm sure that's true.
Hildy!
I'm getting married tomorrow.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Seventy-five.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I'm sure you haven't any.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
Where'd she go?
Fine.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
You haven't seen anything yet.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
So long.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
Your luck's not with you now!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
You -- you --
Keep away --
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Oh, I'm sorry.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Hold on a minute.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
I'd like to think.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Where's Bruce?
I'm finished.
What did you do with her?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Will you come here?
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Murder, uh?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Thanks.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
You know you did!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
All right -- all right!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
I'll have it in a minute.
So long, Hildy.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Yeah. But I --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
I did.  Hold the wire.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I can't.
I'm telling you!
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
They're not human!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Get the Governor on the phone!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Forty dollars.
Who do you think!
Come on, fellas.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
She and Mollie were talking.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
Yes.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
I'm starting my own collection.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
I don't know?
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
You taste it.
That's it.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Fair enough.  The river.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Wasn't it lovely?
Grace!
We did the decent thing.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Really, that's a long time.
Huh... what cone?
Cool.
What about R.J.?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Where's that?
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, come on.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Nice.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Now, what makes you think that?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Turn that fucking radio off!
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
It's a girl.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What!
I gotta open the gate.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
That's nice.
How's he get around out here?
That seems likely.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
No please, let me sit this one out.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You find something, Georgie?
Yes, sir.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Huh?
Huh?
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
What! God damn, how many?
Where we headed?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I pray to God there is.
Right.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Aw, fuck.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Right...  ...come on.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
It's going famously, son, famously!
It's embarrassing, okay?
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Like father, like son.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
When you were a little French girl?
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Shh.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Unnhh.
Urgh.
Hi. It's Nathan.
I just want to talk.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
No. You look so beautiful.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
That's Lila?
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Please let me go with you.
Very well.
But I like being human now.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Ouch. Yeah?
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Nathan told my brother.
Ready!
You've got to respect that.
How's it going?
No biggie.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Yes, darling.
Yes, darling.
Yes.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
I guess.
Such as what womanly things?
That was wonderful!
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila...
Oook. Oook.
Ooka.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Even better.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
here, here.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yep.
Mm hmm.
Check!
I've never been to Louisville.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Thank you.
All I want's the money.
Good, good.
It's possible.
For who?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Kiss off.
Hi. How's business?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Where?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
I said we're leavin'.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
I'm a businessman, kid.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Want some free advice?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
I asked around.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
A son.
Aw, Eddie.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Yeah. Just like that.
Glad to meet you.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Ten dollars.
Call it.
What?
Since four.
Fine, thanks.
What bus?
Fair.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Okay. So what's your name today?
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
I've got something in my bag.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Me. It's Eddie.
Is he a winner?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Well, what's the matter?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Twelve. Cross side.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
No.
You lived like this once.
Yes.
What?
You're not them.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Okay.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I was so scared.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Good night.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I'd believe him.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
You have to leave the White House.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
He's a good man.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Can you believe this?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
I'm thinking.
Can't this thing go any faster?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
She didn't take my name when we were married.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Great.
I had a feeling you would.
Then God help us.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Yes, Sir.
Better than we thought.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
How long would their shields be down?
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
I'm a dancer.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Papers, sir. Got it here.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Alexandretta. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
It's war.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Yes?
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
I usually don't.
Lower me down.
Are you sure?
Mine, too.
No?
Don't know. Think of something.
Where is it? I want it.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Good point.
Right.
There were rats, Dad.
Look, can we discuss this later?
I came here to save you.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What???
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What?
Brody's this way.
All right Dad -- tell me.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I was the next man.
And do I detect a rebuke?
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Ready.
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Come on -- come on!
No.
My name is Kazim.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
Just a routine inspection tour.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Finally!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
You should have been there...
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
I don't like to show off.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Two are still missing.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
The old man saw it in a dream.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
THE WHAT?!
It's starting to let go!
I know the feeling...
What does the writing say?
Just try and control yourself.
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
No -- real food.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
A what?!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Quiet!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
No... they won't kill me.
Not quite.
It wasn't him.
Where are we?
That a new Datsun?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
No.
You said it.
Hear voices don't I.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
We get on a plane.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Good Idea!
You eat it.
What was?
Follow it.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
Try another language.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
Wait.
I made it work.
What are you looking at?
This...is not going to work out.
Why not?!
That place. By the window.
What glasses.
Just hold them close and stay still.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
It wasn't like that.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Too late.
You have to! Quickly!
I can't see a thing.
Come on.
I've got an idea.
Well...?
Where've you been?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Looks like you can have all you want.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
That's nice.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
It'll remind me of you.
What part what?
I insist.
Rene?
They took the tapes.
It's just money.
He's not an ordinary man.
We insist.
What things?
Oh...that's okay.
Do what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Thanks.
Oh yeah, thanks...
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Sir?
Yessir...very good sir.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I didn't say anything.
Yes?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Like there's someone else here.
Me still. They left you alone?
I am sort of scattered.
That you're not crazy.
You did.
Is that Ryuji?
Why'd you run off?
You seemed interesting.
Last night?
You did.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
He must be a good friend.
Oh sure.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
We figure out if it's in here.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
You've  been there?
Why?
You can say that again. What do we do?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
What?
I've never met anyone like you.
Do something!
If he was able, what would he say.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Why?
It is?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Whoever took it does.
So we better get started.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
For reading.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Monday.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
What do you mean, what's it do?
...fuck is this? Fuck!
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Before you go...
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
I didn't want to leave it there...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
What's the difference...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Yeah.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
What do you mean?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Alright. What did you think?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
If you want to do it.
Good. I want to talk to you.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
You charge by the hour?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
No.
You believe that?
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I don't know what to do.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
What?
You called me.
Where you staying now?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
A delivery device for nicotine.
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
It acts as a...
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Chapter and verse.
Here. Got pictures.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Mr. Dumbarton.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
No frown lines.  New watch?
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
Did you see the tape?
I know you do.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
And you've always loved him?
To him? He's a sick freak.
But why him?
So I hear. Is that all?
Have you tried the duck?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I know.
Oh Miles!
What do you want?
Those are gifts.
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
Please! Leave the house.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
You used his credit card.
He was right, wasn't he?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I wish I had your discipline.
He has a reputation for being tough.
I'm dying.
Shit.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Excuse me?
Heh heh.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Rex, please.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Video.
No. You're not.
HA!
What...?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Miles.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Who's "Patty."
Who's Rex's guy?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
You're a peculiar chap.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Stunt?
Oh, yes. I heard.
Oh, no.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Lower the boats!
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Yes, of course.
What happened to your money?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
You win!
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
That's none of your business.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Hurry up and get dressed.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
You weren't so bad yourself.
You always want to run everything.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
To New York?
Of course it is.
Yes.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
That's silly.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Amazing.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
I'm out! I'm out!
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Get out!
Yeah.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
Yeah.
Okay, pete. 
Yeah.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Go on, Willie.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Where you going, boss?
There's a word - orders.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
No, I did not.
Dave?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
There were admirals.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Tough day.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Well... yeah.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
How many men?
No.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...and your General?
Ever ask him?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
And Oswald?
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
And what would I have to do?
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Who was there for your ass?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
In his inside coat pocket.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
What time do you have to be there?
Arrest me.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
That's my diet shit.
Take your time.
Can you do it or not?
In cash.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
The Delfonics.
Are you?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He called you?
You're not old. You look great.
What'd ya see?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I don't care.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
When did you decide?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
In the bag underneath.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
I'm sure.
I didn't say you did.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Who's the other one?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
But you didn't do that.
What about me?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Gimme one anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Kinda.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Baby, I didn't --
I told them.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I can do that.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
You lived in Japan, when?
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
All right already.
What's your cost?
That's good money.
Okay.
You're outside?
An employee I had to let go.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Not now, pick me up.
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Livingston, huh?
Haven't a clue.
House.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Hear what?
Did the police contact you?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Is that what I think it is?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Winston found you.
Have her bring the money here.
I know where it is.
I know where to turn.
Give me his home number.
Where do you want to go?
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
They're not interested, Jake.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Now what?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Why do you say that?
He told me he was going to Hell.
Her knee acting up?
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
She talk about the boys?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
You should go back to her.
What?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
I haven't seen her in months.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Where is the lamp?
I don't know.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Why you left.
I don't like things that make you cry.
What's wrong?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Get your clothes off.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
That's your decision.
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
He did? When?
I don't believe this.
Let go!
I can do anything I want.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You know who I am.
Long time ago.
Shows how much you knew.
The Ladder?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Never?
What is it?
One drop?
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I don't know what to say.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Call my chiropractor.
I'm awake?
I need to see you, Jake.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
Who is?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Died?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Alright, asshole.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
We don't have a choice!
We made it?
Delongpre! Out of time!
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Get out of here!
He came for me, I had to run!
Where'd you get the gun?
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Let's move out!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I don't know!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Suit up.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
You just keep an eye out.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Med-kit?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Oh sure, all the time.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
She needs a little time.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Well, do something!
Shut up, Thorgan!
You lost the charge?
Maybe she tripped.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
You need to get laid!
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Oh shit! There he is!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
You're crazy!
Hockey player? He's not a ...
What have I done?! Idiots.
Sure but what good will that do?
Here --  Take him home.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Full throttle! To port!
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Where is he?
Do I need any more authority?
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
I don't know if I can do that without a...
My kids were on that beach...
No, we just checked the beach...
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Why don't we just tow it in?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
That means closing the beaches.
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Some friends and me took a house.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is anyone having this...?
Is that a boat?
He's busy.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
So that's cool with you, then?
Or something.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Huh?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Okay.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I don't really know anything about it.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, more commercial stuff.
You're kidding!
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But you're old!
God, you're so young.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
I am a suicide risk.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Unfortunately, yes.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
It was magnificent, man!
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Share the love, Tits!
You sound shocked or something.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
A Pilates machine?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Carrie.
You can?
Do what?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
Early, you are so sweet.
What'll we do out there?
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
If you say so.
What happened to Adele?
...I do.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Lighten up...
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I don't know.
...Brian hurt his foot.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Wasn't my fault...
17.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Did what take?
Yeah.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
You think he's got any herb?
Yep.
Right.
Who?
Yeah. She's only 13.
What are you talking about?
Good luck?
Shut the fuck up.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Na.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Right now?
Hold on.
Is it cold?
She won't? Why not?
Tonight?
Yeah?
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
But I'm scared Telly.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
I guess so.
One.
No.
I tested positive?
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Passion...
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Mine?
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
You've heard the stories right?
But then I won't need your money.
Four-thirty in the morning?
It's me. Telly.
Yep.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
To come?
OK.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
I wouldn't know.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
Homesearchers.
What?
Sit down!
Local?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
It's a voice modulator.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
You're not going to tell me that.
Because she's the type.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
You like to brag, don't you?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Very good.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Thanks.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Fuck off!
I just can't believe it.
He was watching you.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Of course.
Nothing.
For what?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Bingo.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No Frank.  No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
We're not sure.
But we heard him.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
About a quarter to one.
Ten days ago.
Through a rental agency.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
A building?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Uh huh.
When I was very young.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Let's change the subject.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Why?
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I'm sorry.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
For emphasis?
What?
Can I come in?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I'm sure you are.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<u>What</u>?
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Yes.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
But there is another entrance to this place.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
The Fortress moves?
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
I'm not sure.
You will know, in good time.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
Let us wish him peace.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
Saddles.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
Yes.
I cannot betray my bride.
You will not, then?
What business?
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
To the place where Death lives.
Not sleepy, either?
These we'll pay for.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
And mine goes with you.
No.
I don't think it's working.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
We have plenty of hares.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Hush!
Look at its insides.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
Then look!
That I am, my lady.
The Widow of the Web?
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is too late. He has drunk.
That is true.
No, she was not as beautiful.
No.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah.
Do you need money?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Perfect.
No.
I never rent my gear.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Yes.
Yeah, what?
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Mathilda, listen!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Fine...
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Yes... Twice.
No...
Why am I such an authority?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I have new dreams now.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
You need a ride, Preacher?
Can it kill me?
You have?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
We can do it together.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
You like to take walks?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't be so sure.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Pacifica, California.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
This guy's not a murderer.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
Is that right?
You tell stories?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Saluting.
What, come on?
Don't do this.
Where am I?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Steph.
I need your help.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Good morning.
Oh, that's not mine.
What do you mean?
What?  Who are you?
It's yours.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Of course.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
What?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
OK.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It's me, Yuri.
I can't tell you.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Are we done for today?
Get up.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Thank you!
No, she was crying her eyes out.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Aristotle.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
What's the point?  Look at me.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. He has it sent out.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
So?
I will...
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Is he the only one?
What, like on va-kay?
Absolutely!
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Of course, I do!
Your what?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
See?
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Do it now!
Oh, yes...
What will become of me then?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
And, now?
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
And who might that be?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
There's the way, mates.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Mean you to seek him out below?
Did you bring me here to sup?
Patience, lad.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
Where?
That's it then... the ring!
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Never.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Be patient.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Oh, la...
Everywhere!  Ow!
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Dead, dead, dead.
Sorry.
Only that?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Heading north still?
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
You follow.
What are you doing?
He was there and then he wasn't!
Mom said I should.
Who are you?
Here, honey!
What's wrong?
No.
Is that legal?
Monday.
What's that?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
You look better without make-up.
Yeah.
Really?
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Are you afraid of heights?
What?
He's got a standing invitation.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
We've known each other since grade school.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
What are you on?
He buys and sells the world.
I'm not.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
She's out with a friend.
Uh huh.
Not a shower.
We're getting out of the ground today.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
To check up on me?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll hate you forever.
Goodnight.
No.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
Hey...hey!
Oh, okay.
A friend of yours is here.
I might have a solution.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know.  Why?
What I'm not.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
What do you know about me?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Yes.
Here.
I'd build a house.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Oh.  Sorry.
She's a little sad, is all.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You let him pierce his nose?
Where is he?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Where have you been for a week?!
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
My stupid back.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I think so.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I can hire workers to help me.
I can't pick you up.
I didn't think you'd come today.
What did he say?
Does Alyssa know?
Don't even...I'm there.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
His father is a man.
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Please don't leave me.
No.
Can you stay for dinner?
This is what he wants.
What did you say?
Can we really help build a house?
Dad's home, already?
Better make it a week.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But you can't.
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Claude.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Here!
That's because I've never been here before.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Good old Monroe.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
What'd you say?
Yeah, I want some pie.
So you made a generous contribution.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
So?
Forget it.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
The hell you talking about? What train?
I don't know. Who do you want?
What am I gonna eat?
Him?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
That was five years ago.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Goodnight, Ray.
Don't touch that car.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Go where, Ray?
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Why the hell not?
So?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Move it out.
Just like Elvis.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Jenny?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
And he's dead serious.
...their damned souls will be ours.
All right. Let me out.
Noon...
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
An angel?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
What can I do about it?
Release the evil?
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Everything's fine, pop.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Coulda been much worse.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
'Bout time...
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
You followed him?
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
School?
Basically, yeah.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Where do you send them?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I'm Mary 2.
Here.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
No.
Six. I go red next year.
K.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
It's different now. Help me.
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I have.
But what is this -- why?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
How will they know we're coming?
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
We'll be all right...  We will...
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
I doubt it.
You know, Jessica.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
I have always been here...
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
This is our bedroom.
What do you mean by that?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
As best we can.
Or not so recently?
Over there.
Pete... Don't...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Alice, I...
Alice?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
The wife killer?
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
What's the word on the street?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
What about yesterday?
Coming up.
No... I don't. Why?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
My... My head.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
That's absurd.
I like to laugh, Fred.
Yeah?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
I guess so.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Okay.
You know who it is.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Sorry... I...
Sure. Sure I do.
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
Come on.
Oh, read it!
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
That's ridiculous.
It certainly is.
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Yes!
Please don't call me Lovey.
I'm thinking.
Just call me Barney.
Horns? What kind of horns?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
In a quandary.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Say, what about that gold deal?
No.
Nothing. Why?
Over by that hill.
Leaving?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
We follow many.
That's intelligent.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
You're startled?
Yes, charming.
Suppose she should leave it?
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Oh, I'm so glad.
Now, what would you like to do?
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
What is it, my son?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Why - I'm sorry - but I—
I don't see that there's anything to say.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
She's going with me.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
My name's Sondra.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
English!
Go? Where?
Please don't go.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Cowan--
It's not even a fucking door.
And if I say yes?
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
What happens if I say no?
All the time, sir.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
You don't know the half of it.
Why?
Let's check am out.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Get back in the car!
We're rising.
The Pentagon.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Do his job.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Do have any idea what I just said?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Yeah, Kay?
They're not my pals--
This guy.  Where was he?
Fine.  Good.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Agatha...
Can you see the balloon man?
Wait.
What --
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
That's comforting.
It's all I could safely move.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
How do I find the --
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Lara --
Don't worry, Lamar.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I'm fine.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Run the subscription list...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
No maglev system.
Yeah?  So?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
I need help with her.
That's great.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
No.  He got tired of pretending.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Who said I would?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
You say some of the children died?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Hold that thought.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
The female.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
We know why John was tagged.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Not.  Now.
My God...
What?
Where are you?
How?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Right here.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure.  Raincheck.
I forgot my glasses.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You mean after he lost your son.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
You're Bobby, right?
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
What's 'incidentals?'
See you later.
No.
We're in Fashion.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
I don't get it.
She'll be out in a minute.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Where's Ricky.
Why?
Pshhh...
That's why they call it the smart money.
They were out of line --
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
He'll work it off.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
What is it?
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Take a few days --
Good morning.
Traveling light. I like that.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
It's not losing record.
Yeah. I know the number.
Bye.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
To keep?
You sure?
Forty-six.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Well, I don't want to walk.
What the fuck do you...
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Like I said, I don't know.
You would think.
Fine.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
She was jonesing for me.
We're getting whacked.
You're out of money?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You're not getting a gun.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
S'up.
A little.
Cool. See you later.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Soho Grand, right?
The Soho Grand?
No. What is it?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
She poured it for --
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
A rose by any other name would --
Bet you like that shit.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Now.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Elijah who?
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Next week, Brother Minister.
Why do you ask?
I know.
Yes. Did you eat?
Hush your mouth.
I'm not made of glass.
The talk is everywhere!
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
You have to sleep for three.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm tired of praying.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
What did I tell you about assuming?
That's right.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Say what you're saying.
I say a lot of things.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
With him?
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
You hear me, girl?
Me?
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
I'm not... easy.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I'll call you tomorrow.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you know who I am?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[And?]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Yes.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
I'm a bargain.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
No, that was in Columbia.
No.
I'm sorry.
I know you're not.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Your father has business.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Could I stop you?
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Because...  I was already dead.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
What was her name?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
She understands men.
[No. Why?]
You do?
That's ridiculous.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
So am I.
That's what friends do.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
What makes you say that?
Yeah, sure.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, it ain't your baby.
What happen?
Who?
Were the lights on?
I don't.
I really should get home...
All right.
I'll see you around.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
That's the one.
Sure, what?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
You gotta good heart.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
What, Ma?
I don't know. I don't think so.
She didn't look Italian to me.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
What nurses?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
That's all right, that's all right...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
Hospital.
There's only one way.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
I don't drink intoxicants.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
He can't take much more time on the table.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
When?
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Right.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
I like an olive.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
I don't get it.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
Of course not.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
You think he won't.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Second pint.
Yeah!
Thanks.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I don't think so either.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Morning, Captain.
What's that, Henry?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
With all of it?
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
No, thank you.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yes, sir.
Money.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
All set, Ann?
Wait a minute . . .
Oh!
In what man!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
He's watching the other door.
Beany!
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
John Doe Club?
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Huh? Get what?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
That's too bad.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
No, sir.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
You're my hero.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
I what?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
What's the suspect's name?
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
I'll give you something.
Spread it out.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I know.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You living together?
I think I can handle that one.
I think so.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Still needs work.
Yeah, first and second.
The jockey!
He's cutting down the visibility.
Good question.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
You worship yourself.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
Just now.
And you think he'll...
Scottie...
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Define concern.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Yes.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Okay...
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Because I took it out of your memory.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
True.  But why?
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
At least a day.
Who?
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Cleaning up a mess.
Yes.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Realize?
Yes.
Sorry?!
-- Standard.
How can we reach Phaedos?
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Activating Power Beam!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
... I just pray we're not too late.
TRICERATOPS!
THERE'S THE COMET!
LET'S FLY!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
A real shame.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Strength in numbers!!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Tell me about it.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
You scare me, Charlie.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
You got men on Profaci's place?
No. I'm here with you.
It's too late.
London?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
I'm doin' business here!
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He's trying to make it.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
But that's an hour's drive.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Don, I'd be honored.
The name's Charlie.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
And the Jews?
I'll take care of the Boss.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
I turned him down flat.
We can operate around these guys.
Shuddup.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything!
That a Jew compliment?
I don't know. I guess it was...
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Well - you'd need a body.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Ohhh, nothing.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
What's the "bad" part?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<u>What</u> union?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Uh-huh?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
I'm good.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What pictures?
Mother!
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Mm hmm.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
... Manly?
Yeah.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
Let's send out a pigeon!
No!
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Is the wind tired out there?
Have *you*?
No--not offhand--
Right now--everything I own--!
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
Great saints!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
No wonder--without your dinner.
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Oh--Jim!
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Uh--could--could I help--?
I beg your pardon?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Look! There it is!
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
For one week!
Here--where are you running off to?
Will he *yield*?
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
The man downstairs said number--
Did you say--bus?
Most natural thing in the world!
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Right.
How?
Some committee's got it.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
No.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Terrible, thank you.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Wow!
Saunders--!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
I'm splendid, too.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Well--I can *manage*--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
Do you?
He did it.
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Maybe he won't get up.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Who are you?
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Some people like it.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Sometimes he whistles.
Always.
Yes, sir.
I haven't.
Yes!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, I don't mind.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
That depends on what they see.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
You have?
He did? I play the tuba—
Sure!
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
Nothing.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Had the boys follow us.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Hurry up!
Shhh!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
I wanna see that guy!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Proceed.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Huh?
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Why should you?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
We own an opera house, don't we?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Ja.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
A child? My uncle's?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
South Dakota north.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
What's that?
Oh, I do too, sir.
Looking for?
Who?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What, sir?
Me more than most.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
You must have been concerned.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Why's that?
...And I from Phyllis.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Good, then go.
Mr. Follett.
It's a thought I had.
Do you want to come in?
Mr. Gilroy --
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
I do.
Yes, your honor.
I'd better get in there.
Lily.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Don't need it.
That would explain it.
Oh... not a real doctor.
No, I really don't.
Why don't you tell me?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Hmm.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
That's what I like.
That's... good?
I don't know if --
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Which show was that?
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
What happened today?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
I can tell you anything else.
Holy shit!
All new people start with that...
You're completely reliable.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
When?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Sounds familiar.
I've had worse.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Oh yes, always.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Broad?!
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
I was mistaken.
Yes,... I see.
I know you knew I'd know.
Head hunting.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Atta, boy!
But you're a superhero.
Hello?
Should I kill them?
Frankenstein!
You're a spy.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Not tonight. 
It is?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I just want to be a superhero.
And what if you get killed?
I just know.
Good or evil, what's the difference?
When are you going to take off that mask?
We had an off night, that's all.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Wait!... Look!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
No.
Hey... he's gone.
Not yet.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Whatever our name is.
With or without him, we gotta go!
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Proceed.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
I did, sir.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
No, thank you.
Where are they?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sir.
No, sir, none at all.
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Four o'clock.
The first reports came in at about ten.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
What is that?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
No...
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Well, you shall see.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I don't understand you.
Open the door.  It's me.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
It's me.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
My God, what do you think?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Oh, then you are...
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Yes, sir.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Thanks, Unc.
Yeah.
Don't move me.
What happen?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
That's the sister.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Okay, plan B.
That ain't gonna work.
I don't know yet.
What's the B-G's?
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Better sooner than later.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
It's locked.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I do.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Excuse me?
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
I know.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
This is a knock.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Bite his ear!
20 minutes?
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
That ain't gonna work.
Keep pushing.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
I threw my back, again.
It's an important speech.
San Diego.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Good.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Then I have time for a drink.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You fucked up.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
That's right. That gives you...
Don't you threaten me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I think you're right.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
No way.
Right.
No...kisses to you.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
What?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Laughs.
You're a big girl, huh?
A surprise?
It better be.
Help me get her off the rug.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Young love.
'Daddy has to go now.
No.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
I'll bet.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Yes, Dad.
And I won't never tell about the money.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
How do you mean?
Walt!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Bluebeard!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Mister Powell!
How?
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Why?
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John, where are we g --
Ssh...
She talks to herself.
Nothin'!
Yes. Yes.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Don't you believe me?
You could save him, little bird.
What's your name?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Can I have this?
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
I was praying.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Get the kit!
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
No.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
School.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Okay.
Nancy!
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
Nobody's gonna kill you.
The door was locked from your side.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
No more fights.
It's from Paris.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
An omelet.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Tell me... what else did you have?
What was it like?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
That's right.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Yes, Comrade?
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Go to bed.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
It is Thursday!
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
I think so too.
No visa.
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Me?
You might hold this for me.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Then how did you get here?
What are you after?
What?
Why?
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
I promise... I swear.
Ninotchka, I love you.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
And General Savitzky.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
Much happier.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Who cried that one?
Yes, sweetheart. 
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Good morning, Swana.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
You can't imagine.
Is this your new dress suit?
No thanks, Swana.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
What is this, Swana?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Hello.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
I must ask you to leave.
I told you to go, madame.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
This will do. 
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where do you eat?
Where is that?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
So ... let's go ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
How so?
I figured that out.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
... go on.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
How do you see this?
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
I know it well, sir.
Sir?
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
What do you mean, sir?
"Security" is not strong enough.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Sir?
Thou must.
What ... ?
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Yes ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
She's quite pretty.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
There's no other choice.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
That'll be the day.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Mr. Nixon.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Yes, I understand that.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
POWs.  And their families.
Sir?
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Are you serious?
Is that the truth?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Thank you.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Lost.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
You don't know what he thinks.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
You ain't heard from him?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
That's possible.
No. Probably I don't.
Gun out and up.
So when was he here?
I don't know. He ought to...
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
Yes Sheriff.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Yes. Things fall into place.
It's full a money.
At the gettin' place.
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
You know what's goin' on?
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Screwgie.
Well -- where ya goin'?
You know who it is.
You know she won't be there.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
With what?
I could come back then.
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
Call it?
...Where you want me to put it?
Uh-huh.
The kind with the most poles.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Okay.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Yes?
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
I do like you.
I'm a welder.
Yes.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
No I don't have it.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Yes sir. Two tours.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Oww! My arm, careful!
You think a woman did that?!
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
I know that...
I know plenty.
No, I was just... How you doing?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
I am?
I'm sorry.
This is really awkward...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
I gotta go make dinner.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Make sure it's elevated...
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
He has no heartbeat!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Fine.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
You never know who you'll see.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
No, almost never.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Where are you going?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Hell of a way to die.
A mark, huh?
IT SURE IS!!
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
...that's a good motto.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
...among others.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Half.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
A doctor on the show... why?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
What do you mean?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
It is, if you like idiots...
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
What the hell's going on?
I SAID FORGET IT!
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
David Ravell.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Do not seek the treasure!
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Not that I'm aware.
Okay, Everett.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
No weddin'.
Not your...
Uh-huh.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
It was in his bureau.
You didn't know that at the time!
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
Yes, sir.
I been calling for four months.
Great.
Thank you, sir!
I joined the Navy.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Yeah, I know.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
I don't mean anything by it.
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Aw screw it...
Well, goodbye.
No, sir.
Zack, don't!
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
What?
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
I got my foot on the floor.
I haven't made up my mind.
What do you mean?
No way... Would you?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Really?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
Does it still hurt?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Are those for me?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
So?
I bet you do!
That's brilliant.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Sure.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
But she expects you to marry her?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Not with me.  Not with people.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
She didn't.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Remember that.
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
She better.
That's their problem.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Shut up.
We'd like to come in.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
I said open the door.
It's just the woman and the kid?
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
The hell we are.
How many more do we have after this?
What?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Well, I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
PANIC ROOM!
It doesn't work?!
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Say fuck.
I don't know, why?
Shhh...
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
You know that's bullshit.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man, fuck you!!!
I don't know. Look around man.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
So talk...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
I don't know.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Right on Brother Judge...
Yeah.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Just the legit shit.
If you got something to say, say it.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Bullshit...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
What?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Thank you.
Uh... uh... I...
His journals, letters, maps, books...
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
You got me beat on both accounts.
He's not making light.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
You couldn't have known.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Very well, then.
Lovely.
My pleasure, sir.
Oh?
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
I understand, sir.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
He left us.
I don't care.  I hate him.
I stand corrected.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
Name five hundred.
That's five, keep going...
Thank you.
I am, I think.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
But what about Thomas?
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
Earned.
Worse.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Do you believe that?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
I swear.
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Allman Brothers.
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Why? For God's sake, why?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Well...a touch of the flu...
It's Ellie's cat.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Jesus, the road!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
You're doing fine.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Elizabeth goes free!
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
That so?
It's a pirate medallion.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Ceremony?
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Yes, the rum is gone.
Exactly.
We're catching up!
What?  He never told me that.
How did he get off the island?
Smith.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Pirate.
No.
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
We need to go!
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye!  Avast!
My father.  William Turner?
It's not true my father was a pirate.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Barbossa.
I'll lead them away.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes, I have.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
No.  She hasn't.
Speak.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
It's ready now, I know it is.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Nebbleman.
No, Icky, this is real.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
Been out for six months now.
It already is.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
You're insane.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Blame the victim.
Probably the caffeine.
What did you want my hair for?
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
I remember I was trying to help...
We were different people then.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
It's a miracle.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Yes - Sing Sing.
Dexter.
Goodbye, Stew—
You may go, Smythe.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
No - give you another guess.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
You can't walk out of here like this.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, hello Mother!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah?
Well - it's only April.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Your valet, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
—and that—
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Not since you broke into society.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Staring at us?
Hello, Stew.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Yes - and I'd love it.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Yeah?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Double strength!
I have. Double-strength!
With pleasure, Madame!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
No, sir!
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
That's all I wanted to know!
... Sex.
We're in Pleasantville?
It can't be possible.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
What?
Sure.
Bud brought it to me.
Here's my favorite.
I've got to go ...
I don't know.
Yeah. It does.
No I'm not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Where are you gonna go?
It is?
What are you doing?
So.
With what?
She won't go out with me?
Okay, that's IT!!!
Thank you very much.
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
I don't know.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Neither do I.
Just take deep breaths.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
As a matter of fact he does.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
... Yeah.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Right here.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
What?
Sure ...
Ooomph?
What the hell's going on!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Why?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
What?
Yes.
Yeah ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
I'll never be able to do that.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
What's the rush?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Yeah. 
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
No, no, no.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
That's your fault not mine.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm gonna call you back.
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
This is Georgia.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
....what....?
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I have to go.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Thank you.
Ok.
Hi.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Yes? I'm trying.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok.
It's Barry.
Yes.
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
You can't do that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Well who did?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
337.....I'm sorry....
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
That's that.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Fine, thank you.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
It takes time to process --
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Yeah.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in the house?
Are you serious with this?
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Sorry.
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You ready?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
By whom? The Marquis?
What? What've I done?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
You among them?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Was it impotence?
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
And my own.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Enough!
Quite.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
Yes?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it awfully violent?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Oh, but I am!
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
And I in yours.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Forgive me, I beg you --
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Houdini mice.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
So I've been told.
Uh-hub.
Yeah
There's no call for that language-
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
How much?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I will not defend my life to you--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Not for me.
You will not walk out on me
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
How so?
Sir?
Sir, I-
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
I can't remember the lines!
No -- no -- I mean--
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Uh-huh
Showing life
Right-
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Don't do this
Listen to me-
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
This ain't George's doing--!
Yeah, ain't it swell?
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Get out.
Again.
Jesus
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
For what?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
It's not done.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Jack! Enough!
Whadda you care?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her?
You know, like bang her or anything?
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
What?
Whadda ya mean?
At night?
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
It feels real good.
Come over here.
Oh, Jake.
Who asked you?
What?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
What're you talking about?
I am answering...
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
What?
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Don't make no difference no more.
Never felt better.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Jefferies?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Ever get an answer?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Like what?
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
You did.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Did you get my note?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
You've got a hormone deficiency.
She's all right.
She's just not the girl for me.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
How did you know!
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
Of course not.
Three.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Someone not his wife?
I don't know.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
That's a suitcase?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I do?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
But you're not?
Too close.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Phone number?
A new disease.
Somebody find him a knife.
Down in back.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
Sure.  Sure.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Stay here.  That was my son!
Plato.
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I'll wait for him.
No.  I don't think so--
Jim.  What's yours?
I just don't want trouble.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Judy.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Not lately.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
What do you think?
I need it.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Good Lord!
Just tell a little white lie?
Grandma?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
What?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Listen--
Now that's true!
"Life is crushing in on me."
Who lives?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Oh.
I'm not so bad.
I'm numb.
I felt like it.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
I'm never going back.
There's just one thing.  What about--
I bet you hear everything I say!
I don't know.
Are you?
What?
We have to go back!
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Hi.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
You said you'd call my father.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
No.  Why?
Don't hurt him...
Please, Gabriel, don't...
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
He'll be dead when he does.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
No, no --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
What.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Beauty and fragrances.
We could live it up and --
Nick...
What the fuck is going on.
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Canada.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
Nick...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
I don't know...
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
You said it a million times!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
Samantha.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Why not.
Put it on.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Get out.
...never... tried...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
Take 'em.
Leave the tree.
I don't know... what you're...
GO!!!
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
It's a roach, guy --
Yeah.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
I'M NOT NICK!
They changed the layout.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Now where were we?
Yes.
Fine, now.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Who?
Where was she from, Compton?
Was he all pissed off?
How do you know all this?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
...What bar?
Yeah.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
You can do some crazy things with it.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Sure.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Give me my book.
Who gives a damn?
Sorry, it's my book now.
Like hell I am.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Don't ask me that.
Nope.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
It's a surprise.
No, I'm not!
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I can' take you to a hospital.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
A few cops.
Where?
That was the plan, we meet here.
We can't take him to a hospital.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
If we don't, he'll die.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Maybe he did.
Nobody. The light was bad.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Yeah.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Hold on.
I suppose it is.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Will she be dark or fair?
You're not going out to look for them?
What?
So did I. They were in it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
All right. I'll tell you.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Finished, son?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You want to split up? --
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
I don't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Yes, people make me restless.
They went on like I told you.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Maybe in Sonora.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
What's the use.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Good night, Steve.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
No. We're not stayin' --
But you're his brother.
I think he wants me.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Hello Ray.
No. I never date outside my race.
Open chest!!!
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
It looks like the furnace.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Shit!
Can you feel that?
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Then what are we going to do?
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I don't care. You pick.
So, whatever happened to her?
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Are these all the subjects?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What is it, Dwight?
What?
That's why we came here, remember?
Yours, or the turkeys?
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
It says, "Ray."
"Fucked me."
What happened?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
You don't think...
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Is there a killer loose?
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Why?
She sure can pick 'em!
Let me see!
Oh Mom...
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
This is so silly. 
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Oooohhhh.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Bon Appetit!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
No.
Yes.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I can't understand it at all.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Weren't you afraid?
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
A job?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Not from me.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
But it's a small room, Jason.
I have to go —-
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Uh—huh.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me what?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
I don't know.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
Unless what?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
Thank you, my dear.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
She's not been here for a long time.
Please.
What did he say?
Why
What?
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Nine years.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Videotapes.
Everything about sex.
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Don't you want to make one?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Sometimes. Afterward.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
No.
No.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Don't you get lonely?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I'm not planning on it.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Why not?
But I don't understand --
Yes.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Mmmmm...
I want out of this marriage.
He does.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Did you find him attractive?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I guess.
Yes.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
But he won't.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Why not?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
Why did you do that?
You don't know that for sure.
You touched him?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
I don't want to discuss it.
Thirty-two dollars.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Nope.
What do you get?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
No.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Yes.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
Right now.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
What's so stupid about it?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Did he put you up to this?
Where are the tapes, Graham?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
So is my wife, asshole!!
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
All right, jesus.
Was he nice to you?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Sure.
No, nothing.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
We live in 703.
Just breathe normally.
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
OK. I'll think about it.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
BREAKING OUT
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
He was adopted you know.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Of course.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
What show?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
It'll just take a second.
Good. That's good.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
Gary.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Well, in that case...
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
What color is it supposed to be?
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Whoa.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
You know that chick?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
So what's the plan today?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
What?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Shut up. Shut your face.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Nope.
Obsessively.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Slaughterhouse.
It's private.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hold on.
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You need a new car anyway.
Why don't you come in?
Maya, how are you?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
The Windmill.
Try it.
I know. I love that.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Thanks.
A paper?
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Well, nice to see you now.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So how're you doing?
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Exactement!
Where?
It tastes old.
Does she ever answer back?
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
That's weird.
...I will.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
I'm looking!
Got it!
I'm close.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Graham.
Edgar, come inside.
I have some upstairs.
It's old Morgan.
Where are we going to sleep?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
The footprints.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Why not?
What did you say?
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
It's like War of the Worlds.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Right.
Yeah... that must have been it.
I'll be long gone.
I expect.
He is that.
I understand.
Anybody got any ideas?
I'm going to California with my brother.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Believe it.
What's that?
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
You're kidding.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Rae, I need help.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
Luck, I guess.
It is that.
So we understand each other?
You like a good saloon?
So-called?
Who's the owner?
What do you mean?
That was my plan.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Please.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Impossible.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Is that a problem?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Who are you really?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Hello, Hal.
Clyde.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
I know what you mean.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Precisely.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
Lainey...
I could get the death penalty.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
This is the story.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
The background is.
Don't you?
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Is that why she left you?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
Thanks.
You use needles?
That's good.
How do you draw now?
I guess they don't.
Look over there.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Words.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
You do?
Maybe.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Standing next to my window.
Dead people.
I know.
Like what?
S-ssssstop it!
It's our pleasure.
J. C. Penny's?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
What's a "little while?"
Not lately.
I didn't do anything --
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
I could. You sucked.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
Harvest moonshining!
"Blood?"
-- It's not me!
Amends...?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Nothing to tell.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Don't look.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Spider.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Why bother?
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
That's not funny.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Starla, it ain't --
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Good.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
What?
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Out.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
My present?
Grant, you're sick!
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
How much style?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
A what?
Having fun.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Yeah.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
How do you know?
Yeah?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Well, thanks for the lift.
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
You sure do.
That's me.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
What's your twenty?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
What does the old Timex say?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Yeah, guy?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'll believe it when I see it.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
That's the point, Dickey.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Ww... uh...
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Damn... alright then.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I got his machine.
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- You can and you will.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
Yeah... Sid?
I'm here.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
What are we talkin' on the split...
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Security's locking down the elevators.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
You're not Gibarian...
Didn't you talk to Snow?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Why did you agree to come here?
Yes.
Shut up.
And professionally?
Why?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Not necessarily.
No.
Human beings can die.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Just get him to stop.
I'll go with you.
Why?
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
Let's go home.
You don't love me.
No.  I love you.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
Do you?
Rheya --
I'm disgusting.
I never said I didn't.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
No, Ma'am.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
I came on at 8:00.
No kidding.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
You don't like him, do you?
Tell it like it is.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Oh that thing in Queens.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Pretty bad.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Yeah.  It's all over.
So.
Sure we are, let's go!
I'm all right.
What?
Get in bed.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
I can still use a gun.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I had to follow her to a store.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What're you talking about --
I watched TV.
What's the difference?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Call a cruiser!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Right behind you, T.J.
No, sir...
I'll prove it!
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Yeah, I think so.
Mom and I got plans.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
No, no.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Don't be pitiful.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Lemme down, bugface!
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Frmpph-yrr.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
He knew.
I hate people with alliterative names.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Strong...
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
It'll shut itself off.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
I will finish what I've begun…
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Really, Professor, I--
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
No, no!  Not there!
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Plenty.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Who is it?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
You stink, Sefton!
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Take it.
Thanks.
Forget it.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
How much more do we have to take from him?
You are talking crazy!
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Abfuehren!
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
You're teasing me again!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
She'll never forgive me!
What do they always say?
I'll open mine, too.
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Are you questioning me?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Give me the radio.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Not particularly.
HoS qorDu. 
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
The station complement was nineteen.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
On screen.
What happened to you?
It's our pleasure.
Please, please.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
You could say that.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
No.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The thought had crossed my mind.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Aye, sir.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Scotty...?
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about surface life signs...?
Go, Sulu!
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Indisposed, sir.
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
But, why?
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!

Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Yes... But -- how...?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Success, my lord.
Yes, my lord!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
How is that...?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
That's all you have to say?
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
And who am I hiding from?
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Ssssh!
What do you want with us? I demand --
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Visual --
KHAN!
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Spock?
Scotty, let's have it.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Uhura, patch me in --
Spock...!
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
It is still regulation, Admiral.
Take the test again.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Aye, sir.
Where must you go?
You do this -- for friendship?
... They do, indeed.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
What do you think, Spock?
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
... My God...
That is what I said, Doctor.
... Best shot...?
Reading the patient's vital signs.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
I suppose they told you that...?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
What do you mean now?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Right.
Kirk. They're gone.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Permission granted.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Yes.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
The tank will be finished by morning...
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
I will, Admiral.
Weapons systems?
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
... Aye sir...?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Aye, sir!
Uhura!... Where!
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Two?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Millions?
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
... Are you joking?
That's the ticket, laddie.
Tell her I feel fine...
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Why?
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
... an offlander?
I understand.
Perhaps, that is true.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Captain, Geordi...?
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
From the mission...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Fail-safe?
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
I'll be in Engineering.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
We're not going anywhere.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
You've not aged a day since then?
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
I'm not letting go of him.
No, sir...
No, sir. It is a gorch.
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
I believe so.
Understood. Keep me informed.
There should be some kind of manual release...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
We're crossing the threshold!
Great name. French?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
The invasion plans.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Some.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Life signs?
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Riker here.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
I didn't mean this future.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
If they're even looking for us...
Come on...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Now there's a poser.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
We were until your torpedoes!
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
Barely.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Very much.
I checked the data banks, yes.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
ALL uniforms?
Do we report this, sir?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
There's a reward for your death.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Right -
You hear that?
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Spock, you want to know something?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What's left of it.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
I think  not.
Nevertheless.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
What exactly does that mean?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
I know.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
You're working late.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
To happy endings.
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Good work. The download?
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Emergency force fields are holding.
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is... striking.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Counselor?
This isn't real.
You sick bastard!
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Do you have life support?
He wants to look me in the eye.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
That will never happen.
If you don't mind.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
Your new chair, sir.
Still well on our side...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
You know I do.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
I have no reason to.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I know.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
What's this all about?
We are.
I am.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
He's a very unusual android.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Yes, Praetor.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
She is here.
They're holding position.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Silence, Romulan!
For the moment.
I don't want to scare them away.
I don't think so... 
Thank you.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
I understand.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Elmo's...
About five miles back.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
When can we expect containment?
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
You're not hearing me.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
What?
This is George Fox...
Watch it. They're coming out.
Marc Shermin.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
What.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Gas good?
You'll see.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
My... husband.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
You. Mouth closed.
No.
Yes.
Shit!
Three nights... two days.
No.
When we get here.
Why?
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
The car will stop?
I was afraid.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
That was beautiful.
Yes. Sing some more.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Come on.
Where did you learn that?
I can't stay on this planet.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
I understand.  Thank you.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
You could have killed us both!!
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Sure.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
We're ready.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
No.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
It was a man though... right?
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Just not the eyes.
What's all this squid shit?
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Fuck you.
What're you going to do?
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Thanks, Max.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Shutup a second!
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
W'sup, Max?
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
I intend to.
Where's Faith?
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
Naawww.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Jesus, Mace!
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
Fire's out, isn't it?
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Aw, Mom!
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
You really want that on your head?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
This isn't in our database?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I don't believe this.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
How long ago?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Huh?, sir.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
The man knew how to dress.
This is some serious shit.
You got a point there.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
What's up?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Yeah, of course.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
I'll be back.
Yes, sir.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
You knew it was me all along?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[What does the file say?]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Sounds like fun.
The same.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
It's over for you.
I know, I know.
I don't know about that.
No. Stop, come on.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
...maybe...
Nikki.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Anything.
What else is going on?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
I'm a comedian.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
I understand.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...The red piece of shit over there...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
...Six months.
Fine... I guess. You?
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Goodbye. I lov... 
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
There's the rub.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Ah, there's the rub...
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
Well, that's dumb.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
...People get carjacked...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What Vegas?
You're crazy.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What?!?
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Yea, how much?
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
...gotta...
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
What?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
What a surprise.
No...
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
No.
What was cold about it?
True.
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...you're money...
...it is so on.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Six.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Barzini.
Like hell I will.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
No, just you and Paulie.
We gotta move...
How bad will it be?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
How?
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
No.
That's for you to find out.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Sure.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
I love you.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Oh Michael.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
I do wish to be baptized.
Be patient.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
It's vile.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Okay.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
This is so good of you.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
So tell me.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Sure.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Marge, when did you get here?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello Marge!
And you, sir? Any better?
I don't believe you.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Excuse me?
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the...?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
A ragione. A ragione. 
I can't later.
It's okay.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
No key, huh?
I'll fix some drinks.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You're such a liar...
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
That's an expensive gun.
Huh?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
It keeps ya busy.
What?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I mean porno movies.
Thank you, Travis.
Yeah.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
More people watch it.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
Ouch!
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
With the other hand, right?
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Easy.
Iris.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Pittsburgh.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
Education?
Oh?
You would, huh?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
What's going on?
Thanks.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Don't let him do that.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Well... where can we go?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Why me?
And why not?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Yes.  Hic!
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Thanks.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Yes.
Start with what you knew then.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
I... I need a drink of water.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Nine and-a-half years...
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
... Ernie.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Oh, no, I...
Dad, I...
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
I guess I did.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Why not?
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
What do you mean?
No.
Oh.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I already have.
No. Just a few hours.
Lovebirds.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
If you have some, I'd...
I think so.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
What do you mean?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Cathy!
They're birds!
I know.
I don't know yet.
The little Brenner girl.
It's Alice.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Right across the bay there.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Mmmm.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
The little Brenner girl?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I know, Mother.
I don't know.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
Oh, my God, look at her!
You're doing fine.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
Oh, thank you.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Are they moulting now?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
How do you know Annie?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
He was watching a ball game on television.
Oh, yes.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Yes.
I wrote the letter.
You have a job?
No, tell me.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I'll get it.
Hear, hear!
After the gulls attacked.
...everything I know.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Inland.
Almost two a.m.
How about you?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Well, all right, but...
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
To...  To kill them.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I'm not sure, but...
Can we go on living here otherwise?
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
I want you to help my little girl.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
I've heard of it.
Come in, boy -- come in.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Not yet.
Why, yes.
He was a nice horse.
I wanted to see the white horse --
Don't call me that confounded name.
I am the best man for the job.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Get out of here!
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Only Brother.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye --
Where are they? Last chance.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
Keep that thing away from me.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Yes I do, I really do.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Sign of the dead come back to life.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You mean Alex.
I do. Every day.
I want you... to bend over.
What did I say?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't believe you.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Yes, I have!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
No -- I'm afraid not.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why not, Bobby?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
About five months -- your months.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I can judge only by what I see.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Is it real?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I feel different right now.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
I'm sorry.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
You better get some fresh air.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
He's my brother.
We don't ride with vampires.
You gotta drive!
Honda 250, huh?
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Yeah.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
How do you know they're not?
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
What happens in tow and a half hours?
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Whatcha doin' over here?
Oh, no, you won't.
Mom... please.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Michael!...
Smells like something died.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
I thought we were poor.
Soon.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
In here?
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
No, I'm not...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Because I love you...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
What would that make Mom?
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
The Marines.
Huh?...
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
I don't know who to trust.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Cool it, Palmer!!
Ain't it there?
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
We got morphine, don't we.
Then I'll have to kill you.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
I guess I'm the only one.
Thank you.
When was the last time you used it?
After all this mess.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Little over two hours.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Anyplace but here.
Calm down and get in your position.
So what do you make of it?
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
Hear what?
On the towers?
Where?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Can you show us where they live?
Yes.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Created?
How do you control the Morlocks?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
No...
I don't think that's going to happen.
What's happening to the moon?!
You know I can't.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
What?
How romantic...
Oh?
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I live with it every minute of every day.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
You're not from beyond the valley.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
We all have that dream.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
Is it?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Do you have it?!
I see.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
New Yorkers.
No...
I took a different route.
Why?
I suppose so.
We choose to believe it.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
What's it like where you come from?
For our sake, I hope not.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Depends on what you're seeing.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
And what does that mean?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I never touched your father! I swear!
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
They should just be looking harder.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Well, you belong in one.
How?
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
There're no cars on this street.
William, you're not making sense.
I'm doing fine.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
So it's helping?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
You have no idea what's going on.
It doesn't look all that different.
What for?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
[Beat] Thanks.
No, I'm ok.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Sure.
You remember it?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
What.
See ya.
What?
Yes, baby?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
It's him.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Can't it go to any office?
Call me back.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Oh yeah.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Isn't this fun?
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Get the car.
Which part?
Give me the keys.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I don't know.  I won't be.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Taking a shower.
What happened?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
I... I...
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Yeah.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Just ignore him.
We should have just ignored him.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Harlan.
About how fast was I going?
Shoot the radio!
Hit it.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Yes, Thelma?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Good.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It'd have to be pretty good.
You're drivin'.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Where?!
You got that right.
Say you're sorry.
I'll try to be more careful.
I guess.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Yeah, but he was successful.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What?
Uh-huh.
I am?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Mints?
Jesus Christ you're right.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Am I?
Dumbshit.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
Thanks.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
What's that?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Deco.
Have you seen it?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
No.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
So she hasn't changed?
Huh?
Three different guys?
Oh my.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Surprised?
Do what?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Harvard?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Fucking sickening.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Huh?
You betcha!
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Oh... are you... ?
Oh great, I ran out.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Yeah?
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Mary, come on...
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
I think a little of both.
No, that's really unneces --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
What does the letter say?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Smoke.
Kenny. It's over.
Yes it is.
Says what, Kenny?
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Still heading for Cuba.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
What about you? Where are you going?
Not as far as the election goes.
Good.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
I don't know. I don't know.
I know, I know...
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Hey. Nice tie.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
Oh, yeah -- right.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Ray.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Good.
That's right.
When did we get that?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Watch out!
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
And...
He also said "listen to the water."
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What you call myths, we call our history.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cuz you're a cop.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Sorry.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
So they took care of Leo.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Go ahead, Ray.
Good.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
It's not that.
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
How did you know this was my car?
That's all!
It's classified.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Um. You.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?

You're an animal.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
About as much as they think about killing me.
Are you really that brave?
And now?
Anything.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Take something off.
I was, later.
Well what?
Well?
Remember one thing.
You.
What?  What is it?
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Not anymore.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Yawing right.
Just relax.
The plane is fine.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Any more MiGs?
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I want him!
Come on. I died enough for one night.
Don't.
Skipper, you can't do this!
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
What now?
SHIT!!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Figured out what?
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
So have I.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
What the hell you doing?
Didn't everybody?
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
My wife's house.
Or....
I'm nothing like him.
I never heard that.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
The Last Resort.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Definitely.
Get it, please.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
I know that.
It's about goddamn time.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Why not?
Nice to meet you.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Swallow this.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Where?
Where's Kuato?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Split up.  Find him.
I don't know.
You know I do.
Just think about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Lori, move.
I'm late.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Implanted.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Beats me.  I just work here.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
That a problem?
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
There's something I have to tell you...
Hauser left me a note.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
You two-faced-bastard.
What?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
I think I scared it!
Burt, can you hear me now?
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Well, sure.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
You got that right.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
The rifle.
Oh shit!
Little sons of bitches.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
I'm gonna help you.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
No ties.
What?
You are so full of shit...
You bet.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Yeah, Val.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Okay, ten dollars.
They're working together, too.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Please... I need to sleep...
That-a-boy. Hospital.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
I have to talk to your brother.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Shut your sewer mouth!
Not necessarily...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Right. You're right.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
-- Remember?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
...For ten years, now.
You're doing a murder case?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
You tell me, man.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Badgering.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
A woman.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
What was?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Bobby...
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Yep, it sure is.
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Oh.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
What?
Anything else?
Tell me about the letter.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Where's Hap?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Ever see her with someone else?
Thanks.
Cole said she was 17.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
You didn't do your homework?
He probably wanted to drive over.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Well, why not?
Donna, are you my best friend?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
If I can smoke it.
No, you're the muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Not you, Donna, not you.
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
I'm not.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
James...
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
What were you doing in my room?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
We're late to get to your mother.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Oh, Leland.
Look at this finger here.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
As if I didn't know.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Yes.
Very good.
As far as we know, nothing.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
I wouldn't do it.
I... yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
I know of him.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
I completely understand...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
No, you did fine.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Well...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Yes? Galvin, right?
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Right. Who called?
...and you're going to do that?
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
Yes.
...things change.
I'm sure you would.
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Overruled...
Still looking.
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
And what makes you so tough?
You, you don't under...
No.
I have to talk to you.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
No.
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
Yes. Yes, I have.
...I understand...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Yeah.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Yeah. I'm awake.
The 'History'...?
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
She did?
Should I?
Yes.
Huh.
All right - I've seen enough!
But I think I know where she'll be....
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Would you like some coffee, General?
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
Don't you live at home?
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
No.  I thought you had them.
Right.
They'll probably move at dawn.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's very excited about it.
You get any sleep last night?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Chase, it's Dylan!
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
I'll be there in three hours.
No...
Absolutely.
Is he all right?
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
He was just here!
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Finish, please!
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
A story?
I'm fine.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Yes.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
We were idealists.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Yeah.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Believe what?
Congratulations.
I just can't believe it.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Because it looks good.
Shut up, Phil.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
I know enough.
Me too.
Forget it.
Come on man, what'd they look like?
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Unfurl the squares!
It was my fault.  I slipped.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
They have every right Chuck.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
You do?
I couldn't do it.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Outer.
It hurts too much to care.
About anything.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Joy, rapture...
What?
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Yes, I was.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
How old are you?
Get out.
Fuck me.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
When did you talk to Lula?
Have now.
Forty bucks...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
What I made you do, mama?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Peanut...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Where?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Under a hundred.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
The only one.
You sick?
Yeah?
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
SAILOR!!!!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
That's not why I called.
Yes... Get rid of him.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Shoot him.
No.
Yes.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You heard right.
Well?...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Shit.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Competence.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Don't touch it.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Yea?
No! What gave you that idea?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
I'll miss my bus.
So I'm told.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Miss Sloviak's.
What's he saying?
What'd he say?
Hm.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
I don't know...  Me.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
Because of my coat?
Jealous? Of me?
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
In a minute. Get us a table.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I eat.
Okay.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Oh. Well. I...
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Chancellor.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
All right. This morning --
She's left before...
Hm.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
You got me.
Really? That was fast.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
About the baby.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
And you're old.
Oh?
Some times...
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
James is... I don't know...
This is important.
Taking the long way home.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
It was a beautiful present.
It wasn't like that.
The birthday party.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Next week? The week after?
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
I'm not a monster.
I mean... feelings.
Sure.
Robin.
Cop.
Have a seat.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
Yeah.
They grow outside, don't they?
Yes.
Fairy tales?
No.
What?
No.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
Yes.
I count my blessings.
Yeah.
You are in.
Why's that?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Do you have many friends?
It sounds like you were banished.
They sound like finches.
Ms. Kramer.
The job's okay.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
Bad idea.
How's that?
Have to talk about something.
I'm afraid not.
I don't.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
What did you think would happen?
What did you want to happen?
I want to talk about it now.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
You mean my problem?
What?
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
I see my sister.
Not so fast.
In my bedroom, sleeping.
This is garbage!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
What picture?
I'm just quiet.
I thought you were a dyke.
Sorry.
K through sixth.
What about them?
What?
It's been a while since...
I molested little girls.
What did you do to them?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Why young girls, Walter?
What?
Which brother did this?
What?
I'm not scared.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Fine.
I'm not scared.
Yeah.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Hey, you okay?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
How?
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Hi, lady.
Who then?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
God, I hate that bitch.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Why bring it here?
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Yuh?
I can't... make it... podner.
Give me that!!
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
He's hallucinating badly.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
More so than the shark?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
Yes, maybe that is better.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
And what about you?
Who knows why they all left...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Okay. In a few minutes.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
To do what?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
To the shark.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
What do you think?
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
We'll try again.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Because this is a Chinese radio.
And do you remember where she got off?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
You're kidding!
Is that possible?
You really must do me this one favor.
Who?
He loves you the way you are.
Why?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Yes, of God.
Dear Jesus...
Yes.
Everyone.
Yes.
Yes.
At least once a week.
Where'd it come from before that?
Agnes, how are babies born?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
No.
No.
I could never be a mother.
A mistake...
Not my fault.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
I breathed!
She watches... she listens.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
And then...
Yes I am.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Someone's following me.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you do?
I don't know which one 
Where?
So she sent you?
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
You got to be crazy.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Uh huh.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Two packs a day.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
And you weren't shocked?
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Nothing.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
I knew that after the fact.
Don't deny it!
Bullshit!
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Begin what?
You're what?
She is an innocent.
I'm concerned about her health.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Yes.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
Shurrup!
Y'what?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Just you?
They'll be here.
Spoil sport!
You do - repeatedly.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I'll have a bash.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Yeah, grotesque.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Ah well. Eh, look!
Wake up!
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
He comes from a large family.
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Out where?
Books are good!
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... that's right.
Have they?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Nothing good.
Is there a fire, then?
Eh?
What's he on about?
I'll look after meself.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
But I'm clean.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
We were going to do it.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
No, not me.
What have you heard?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Well ...
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Sorry.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
A proper Aborigine.
Is that you, Roby?
Or something will be able to see us.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
I'll see what I can do.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, you'll follow me.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Take care.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
God I'm hungry.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
Unknown.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Hard to say.
Yeah!
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Shit...
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
What do you mean?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Still unconscious?
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
Good!  That's good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
No.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Oh... God...
Hey!  what about the film?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
Thanks for the thought. 
My signal's fading.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Let's let the machine work on him.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Are they close?
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Anything else?
What killed it?
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
So the next step should be --
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What did it do to you?
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Yep...
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Shit.  When?
What's our weapons situation?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What?
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What's wrong?
Sounds great.
What's the problem?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Compensate!
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
I... I can't!
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Phoebe.
Please do.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
That's right.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
D-day.
Almost four.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
You have no right to say such things!
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
What of it?
What of it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
No-no-no...
You can have one at Max's.
Why not?
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Hear, hear...
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Eve! My understudy...
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I get a party, don't I?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
It won't play.
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many interests.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Twenty minutes!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
For instance - you!
- guilty.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Groom.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Why.
It's only one picture deal.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
You didn't have to tell me.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
No thanks, Birdie.
But she just got here...
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Hmm?
No.
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Probably not.
You rest. I'll get it...
Eve. Eve Harrington.
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Of course.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
- an understudy's performance.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
'Remembrance'.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
I had no idea you knew each other.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Harrington.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
About what?
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just can't believe it.
Well... all right.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
I'm beginning to catch up.
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Not much.
What is he talking about?
How do you mean?
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Too bad.
What's your being married got to do with it?
How about me what?
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
Well...
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--mine's better--
Yeah?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hmm.
--a spy, you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Facts or theory?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
Nixon.
You voted for him.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--shit--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
If he self-destructed.
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
--what?--
Absolutely--
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
I will not talk about the other two.
--you double-checked both sources?--
Go on.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
I don't know titles.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
So?
You're a lawyer and you're here--
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Ratfucking.
Mitchell knew then.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
--yes, yes, what is it?
Good God!
Government. Recently retired.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
I did all right on McCord.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Anyone but Bernstein.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
When so ordered.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
No, none of those.
Sorry.
Thanks coach.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Neither did I!
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Seduce her.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm glad you think so.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
You can't sing at the competition.
What's that?
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Pontificated.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Nothing!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Highly, highly overrated.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
I thought so.
Move with the music.
Nadia, I can't --
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
I don't know.  How do you?
Yeah.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Once, in church, dude.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Observe.
Fuck yeah we will.
Shut the fuck up.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
What?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Andy!
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
It's okay. I can see fine.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Andy! No!
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
What...?
What?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Looks like he lied to you too.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Why the fuck would I do that?
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Andy? Andy is that you?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
You fucking liar!
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Double merde.
When you're older . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
What happened to your parents?
Now just get off the train.
You are the Princess.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
It's not you - it's the dress!
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Anya... where are we?
I'll never let go!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
You'd lose your security deposit?
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
Pray he's color-blind...
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
No. Empress, you --
I should go
And tell me that she's happy.
You gave the orders!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
You don't want my autograph.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
Get him!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
You-you play... very well.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
I'll getcha a piece.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
think that's, uh-
No, so help me.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
It's terrific.
Yeah?
M'hm.
M'hm.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I dunno.
Of course.
I have a tiny apartment.
You don't want me to live with you?
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
G-go on, I'm interested.
M'hm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Yeah?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
No.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
I have a headache.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Trigger.
Hey.
May I see your license, please?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
You're crazy!
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
We're gonna operate together.
She was stealing.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
No.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
It was a wonderful set.
Yeah.
I was very charming.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Would it make a difference?
You're fucking desperate.
Why last?
She's got great tits.
No, what?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
I'm in mourning.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
To dander.  Otis.
I'd say it was down.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Really?
I love her too, Joe.
He's not going tonight.
When does he graduate high school?
She's in ICU.
A perfect night.
Probably not.
There's still time to undo this.
Ryan's novel.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
We're great.
For good.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Well he can't have gone far.
He'll find his way back.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
It's a novel.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Me too.
He's my favorite.
Sure.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Don't be silly.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Elitism?
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
And he doesn't smoke?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Don't go in, Ryan.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
How long ago was it?
No, no thanks.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Oh great.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
I don't mind...
Hm.
And the food sucks, I know.
And Cal's this massive adult?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Neither does Joe.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Well...  I declared war!
You -- you think I'm right?
I'm Princess Bala.
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Want a list?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You held onto this all that time?
Oh no...
Yes...he's wonderful...
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Oh, no, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
...Ants...
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
I'll be back.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Care to make a small wager?
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
That's me. 
Would you like to?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh.
Eight-thirty!
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
How many of those drinks did you have?
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Someone from the office.
As soon as I can walk.
They had to pump it out.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
He doesn't give a damn about me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
A cemetery?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Who'd care?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
I guess so.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Might as well go all the way.
Cheers.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Of course not.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Yes, sir.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Oh?  Oh!
Yes, of course.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Sir?
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
How's that again?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
What does he mean, accident?
You?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
No!
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
I have a vague idea.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Yeah.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Me?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
No.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Important?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
I love you -- remember?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Atlantic City?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
It's a thought.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Dreadful.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Get out --
Sure, thanks.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
No.
Sort of.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Yes, sir --
Call me what, sir?
No shit.
I don't believe you --
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Yeah, it still runs.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
Your daughter.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
No. Walked.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Who knows.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Music?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
It'll get here, soldier.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
Yes.
You can't have water after morphine.
I can handle it.
What are you doing?
Yes, I know...
Both of us...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Nah.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
Why didn't he shoot you?
What things?
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Anyone got a card?
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Needs patching.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
175  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
I'll get you there all right.
Your infrared camera?
26   CONTINUED:  
28   CONTINUED:
Six months.
Why?
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
That's my line.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
A daughter in Oregon.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
You know Meyerling?
Too bad we're heading west.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Go ahead.
I want us to go out.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
How ya doing?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
I want you to go on this trip.
What's that got to do with it?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
It was a mistake.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Okay.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
I'll take care of myself --
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
What are you trying to do to me?
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
So am I, Frank.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
He's a pain in the ass.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Well, I can't reach them.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
How're you doing?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Okay, then.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Get out.
Thanks.
Melvin...
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
Another place where?
I forgot to lock the door.
What's it mean?
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Where?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
How long have you been freelance?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
You're too late.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Ten million --
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
Until a minute ago.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Because he is trying to retire me.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
What do you want to know?
It's not the same, is it?
Why?
Why not?
Tell me about the first time.
No.
The beach?  It was nice.
Thank you.
We split the money?
Except --
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Why?
Shit.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
It's possible.
Average.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
I have all day.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
What's that? Free!
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
I thought that was part of the charm!
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Is it gone four-thirty?
Am I late?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Why don't we go together?
No, the boyfriend.
It just happened.
She's cool.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
You capitalist pig!
Tell me some bad news?
Lucky break!
Did you see anything in the files?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Some deal you did there!
I'm not hungry, really.
What are you talking about?
No!
Doug?
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Sure. Excellent.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
How about you Brutus?
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Whatever!
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
No way Doug, I can't.
No.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
There's nothing there for me.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
No, it should be over soon.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
We don't need you.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Sure!
Uh-huh!
Cool!
That's right.
No!
Yeah.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Can we talk in your office?
We're not sure...
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Very well.
With you.
Heart be still.
I'm sorry about how we --
You're fine like that, Mom.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Demented.
Me.
Why?
Like me.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for something -- someone.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
And why would that scare me?
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
No.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
What about your father?
Anything you want.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
I have expectations, too.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Like what, sir?
I want to come back.
I'd work backstage or something?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Poly-what?
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Learn anything?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Run out of gas?
Five cents, please.
What year?
AM or PM?
...To be traveled through
Then where the hell is he?
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Is Shemp all right?
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Marty.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
The power converter...
That's just great!
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
Perfect...
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
What? 
Dick? Dick who?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Okay.
What do you mean?
Not bad.
They come with the house.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
He never bit me.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Thirty aught six.
Tom...
What're you doing?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Yeah? Why not?
No.
Holly.
It's okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Something mi trabajo.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Okay.
Don't ask me.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
How bad off is he?
You said that once already... Too late now.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Put that down. It's dirty.
How's he doing?
Yeah.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
I just don't want to go.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Stay as long as you like.
It's mine all right.
Hold it right there.
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
They're stealing my chopper!
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Arachtoid.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
What? How do you know that?
To get my guns.
Don't shoot!
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
This is so embarrassing...
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
I didn't drop 'em.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Please, Barton.
Really?...
...Who is this?
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Well... actually, no Bill...
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I need help, Audrey.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
Nope.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Hi, Charlie.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
What do you mean?
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
We gotta call the police –
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
Excuse me?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Uh-huh.
He's a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Physician, heal thyself.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Give you nose bleeds?
Only fry you once.
How's about it, Bart?
When did you start drinking again?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Why didn't you tell me?
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
Nilsen.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
That's right.
Thanks.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Fine.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Fine.  How's your back?
Did you like her to watch?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
What happens to them?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
How's that?
Do you remember his name?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I know what that's like.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
I don't believe it.
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
What do you want?
No.
Did you check all four years?
I don't know.
What about the shit they write?
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
No.
You should talk to him about this.
You want a drink?
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I didn't see you.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
I need a dealer.
Decipher?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, but as a black painter –
What?
You're not?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Very well.
Out?
Yeah..
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
SAMO.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
I guess it was a long time ago.
You're your own baby.
A present I picked up for you.
Me? Why?
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I just don't think you're being fair.
I need this?
No, actually I feel worse.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
Have we?
Yes and no ...
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Yes and no...
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Weird, huh?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
It does to me.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
PMS.
Silent night, violent night...
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Thanks.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Keep it.
You'd be surprised.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
I didn't kill your wife.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
Mr. Freeze.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Can I get some help over here?
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Well...um...her.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I find that unlikely.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
What did you say?
No. You said I. I killed them.
He ran away?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
What?
Recognition, of course.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Banzai.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
What?
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I don't want to remember!
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
What the hell is going on here?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
A man with a death wish.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
You're a genius.
Miss.
... Very good, sir.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
... Murderer...
WHICH CAR?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
What is it you want?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Finding out where she is.
What now?
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT?
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
... Behind the makeup?
What?  I improved her a little...
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
You okay?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
I said I'd check with you.
David, I'm serious!
Hi.....  Roses.
About Charles...
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Thanks, Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Ahm.... .
Isn't it?
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Certainly is.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Okay.....
Why thank you sir.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Uh... Uh...
Heh heh. Thank God.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Uh...
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Dill-wad...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Ah, the witness?
Where did these guys come from?
D.C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Not now Bork.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
This is going to take some time.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
No, I'm not putting up with this.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That's all we need.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
What makes you think she likes me?
All right.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
We were trying to scare your mother.
I got an A!
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
We're...
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
They're dead.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I... I don't know what your name is.
No, dummy.  Two.
Good girrrl!
That's it!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Delia hates it.
Let me have it.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I saw some ghosts.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Attic space.
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Yes. I think so, too.
Oh, fine.
Thank you.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
No.
Yes, Robert. I will.
In a day or two, yes.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Thank you.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
I like to watch. This is fine.
No. I like it here.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Good night, Eve.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Thank you.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I have nothing more to say.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I agree.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
I agree.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
No, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I can't write.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Good day, Sally.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
... Yes sir - elevator!
... Good evening, Louise.
I see.
Yes. It is.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
Compensated...?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
I said - try again.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Look, Johanna...
No problem, Chief.
Right, Chief.
That could be possible...
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Oh yeah, he's good.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Please, have a seat.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
I'm a puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
I'm scared.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
You've always loved the animals.
Fuck Maxine.
Me and John.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm sorry for everything.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Let me try!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Yes?
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Just.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
What's he been in?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Hush, sweetheart.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
No.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
What the fuck is going on?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
He's a selfish bastard.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
What want ye, girl child?
Well what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I likes yellow.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
I don't. I have my own.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
I miss her.
In case of what?
Extra?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
I don't know him that well.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
For what?
I don't want to know.
Who is she? Where she come from?
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
All he can. All he can.
Paul D.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
She was my best thing.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Yes sir.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
We have the urn.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
That fucking bitch!
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Lebowski on the right?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Color?
And what do you do, sir?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Separate incidents?
What's your drink, Dude?
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Maude?
Uh-huh.
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh?
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
The bulk of the series.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Is the car out front yours?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Who is this?
...Us? DUDE
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
WHAT?!
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
Impressive.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
Like cancer with a purpose.
Fry 'em.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
What?
For what?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Did you think I wouldn't?
I'll show you.
Blood...
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
For what?
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
I don't know about this, man --
Human?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Don't even start, old man.
Frost!!!
How do I stop it?
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
How can you tell?
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
I've been better --
What are you talking about?
I know. Take some of my blood.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
For them. But for me --
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Sometimes --
We weren't sure we could trust you.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
He killed them?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Join the club.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--whatever; that's her.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
I don't know. Nightmare.
Yes.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Sleep.
No.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
I can't.
--no, what's wrong with you?
Why?
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
The, uh, blur there.
I can't let you in.
No.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
--go!
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
What?
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--Cotter: shut up.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--I saw what I saw.
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--who?
--Graduate Thesis--
--a Wiccan--
This isn't about us.
Look over there.
--now there.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Asleep--
--I dunno, I just woke up--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
One of the printers.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Shoot.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
I am?
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Your husband.
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I couldn't believe it either...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Yeah.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Marty.
I think someone's watching.
Remy.
Thanks.
I don't follow baseball.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
About ten years.
I own the place.
Uh-huh.
...Hell.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
What do you mean...
No. It just made them feel better.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
What do you think?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
So it would seem.
Has Ray come in yet?
You said the usual--
What's the point?
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Tuesday.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
It must be great.
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
No. not at all.
Yes sir.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
. mommy's here.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
If you want to.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
No. Come on.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No. please. I won't.
No.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
That's good.
I'm doing it.
Whatiya mean?
Beeeee careful.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
No.  Hi baby.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
They hurt his head.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
No thanks. what does that mean?
What?
Nothing.
Yes.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
Am I bothering you?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Maybe so.
I don't know.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
That's what I thought.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Oh yeah?
Okay. great!
What is it?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Dorothy Vallens?
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. okay.
That sounds great!
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Motherfucker works fast.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Get me a six pack.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
Good night.
I would if I could get some sleep.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Allo?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
No more brothers, Diego.
You fucked me, Diego.
Today.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Yes, it is.
Family.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
That was a beautiful message.
What do you guys want?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
You swear?
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
So, we need to get to the source.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't even know your name yet ...
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Let's try ...
I think it'll be a success ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
A name?
How can I give you this statement?
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Yes.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Counsel approach the bench.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
I have.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
No.
No.
Oriental medicine.
No.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What changed?
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
No.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You still haven't answered my question.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
It's okay.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She's waiting in the conference room.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
-- But it's Sunday.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
You better.  Please answer the question.
Really?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
It was a place to start.
Daddy -- stop it!
It's not that long.
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I know. I don't understand it either.
Mom's orders.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
'82.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Was this during Betty?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
You're right -- that is sick.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Yeah.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Want another cigarette?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Clean?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
She starts sniffing me.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
No. I'll do them later.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
No. I can't. Not yet.
What?
Have you ever been to that station?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
I had a temper.
No.
What?
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Frannie.
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm?
What happened?
He yours, sir?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Just some flies.
Go for it.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Spooked?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
That's some terrible shit.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
What it will be.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
That place is already bad luck.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Daddy?
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
That building?
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Ours!
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
But you know he did it.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
All right, Caesar.
No.
This is insane!
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
We're going to need some time.
You betrayed me!
Good boy.
Yes, I understand.
Sure, Gino, sure.
I should have let him kill you.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Five.
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
A beer.  Of course.
Maybe.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Basically.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What was it then?
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You think I'm lying?
Yeah, twice.
An accident.
Trust me, Violet.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
I won't.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Caesar wants me to stay.
I think everything is okay.
Violet?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
So it's time to go home.
We have to go home, Jason.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Jason...  They can't let you go...
MPG Capital.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Yeah, I know...
Really.
Okay.
Excuse me?
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
I want to go home.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I know that.
Listen to what you want.
What?  Like amnesia?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I don't remember any of this.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
I didn't know this would happen.
Who paid the bill?
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
What?
xxxxxx
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
-- we're evacuating the building --
I told you.  You need to rest.
No.
Thank you.
What have you done to my flat?
... have a look.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Well, I ...
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
No, no ... I did that...
Jack!
You remember Alison?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Am I?
You got the wrong man.
He's a freelance subversive?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
We don't make mistakes.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Bastard!!!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
It's you ... it's you ...
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Oh, sorry.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
A heavy Christmas present.
Really.
What?
Cut it out, Sam.
Let go! We've got to stop!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
No you're not!
Where are you going?
Don't do anything silly.
Information Retrieval.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Next of kin!
Yes.
What's the matter?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You haven't switched it on.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
I won't be held responsible.
You're not listening, mother.
Mistake?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I ... uh ...
No need, sir
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Numero, trois.
Fixed?
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
No ...
Two years. Ever since we left island.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Just take it easy.
No!
You're going to live.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
The first is always the best.
You never know.
Yes.
He's working a double shift.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
He'll be all right.
Frank.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
She's no whore, Marcus.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
What's that, Frank?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You learn that in the army?
Frank!
No shit.
What?
What?
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Used to be my partner.
No way!
Nice, Jane.
And the rule was...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
It's not loaded.
Oh, God, no!
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Why?
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Ravenous homosexual.
Good night.
Call if you get weird.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Did you shoot their boots?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
I didn't know you were going with him.
No.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Sit down, stop.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Outside?
Wipe me out?
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
I'll never tell.
Follow me.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Nobody else had it.
That's okay.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
I'll speak to you.
They fired me.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Honey?...
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
It's not.
Yes, sure.
So great -- right?
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Billion.
Excited.
Yeah?
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Great.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Good night??!
That's yes?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
Through the closet.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Oh it's enough...
I already told you I'm not.
Is the manager cooperating?
Of course...it's wonderful.
Murdered man.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Me too.
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Here here...
Yes Walter.
Bye!
What are you trying to say?
What?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Leonard, what are you doing?
I'm totally serious!
I admit it.
Why not?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know.
I know, man.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Didn't you hear him?
I didn't buy it I made it.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
A parakeet?
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What, Mr. De Santis?
Put it down, Walter.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
I can't talk right now.
You're like an undercover guy!
C-connection?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
I thought you didn't respect money!
Gee.  Thanks.
If you see him.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Amazing!
Bummer metaphor.
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
You look like shit, Benny.
Down there.
Yeah, I guess.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Hi, guys.
Yeah?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I think you've forgotten something.
No...
You guys are thrashed.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Water.  Okay.
Not exactly.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Yeah, whoops I came.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
I have cheerleading squad.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Oh.  Good.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
I...
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Vampires of the world, beware.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
I guess.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Sorry.
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Really?
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
No --
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Nee sitch.  No way.
What is she...
Wit-tay.
Oh, please.
Right!
Nice much.
Right.
Run.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
It's all the same thing.
Get over here.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
No, no, it was great.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I'll be back when we lose.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
I got lured.
He's a virgin.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Yep.
That's my job too.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Let me.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
What's so great about baseball?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I heard already.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
I can do that, too.
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
You got a live arm there.
I thought I was--
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
How?
Gimme that.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
God--what a Big League move.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
C ' mon!
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
My right.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
See ya at the yard, Meat.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Jim looking for somebody.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Where does he go?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
What?
What are you talking about?
Philip, if you would rise.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
It's a pity in this...
What do you propose?
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Lester...
702 472 1862.
I don't know.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Honey, come here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
All right.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Yeah.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Why?
You never - ?
No, I'm not okay.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
You bet.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
All right, we're clear.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Call security.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Good luck.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
It's nice isn't it?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
But as much as they loved her...
No.
What? What?!
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Pretty serious.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're not takin' Amy.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
Who were you with?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I really think you're -
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
God! 
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Well, I've been busy. 
You can't talk to me like...
Sam?
Hey.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
I understand.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Yeah?
Now move along.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Fuckers!
For what?
But I'm just trying to leave.
I know.
I understand.
That's enough now!
I'll be right out.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Oh, come on.
Yeah.
It's all right.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Nothin'.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Ginger, honey.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Come on! 
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
You do?
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
No, I'm gonna drive.
They check in alone?
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Two.
Get up.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Pleasure.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Fuck you!
Hey.
You sure?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
I'm sorry.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're probably right.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
"Well done," Cactus.
Why am I still troubled...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I got her...
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
I know.
And...your point?
You've seen me...
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Uh. "Thanks?"
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
This is one way.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
You could've made me lose my call.
I didn't hurt you.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Make a "U" and go back.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
What do you keep making me out to be?
What am I supposed to do?
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
That's not her.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Are you okay?
Put the man back on.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You wouldn't --
Ask them.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Who is this?
Keep talking.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
I wish it had never been invented.
Talk to the man.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
My pleasure --
Are you trying to panic the women?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Better reassure him.
Call me "Nels."
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
There's no lady here.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Undercover.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Yeah.
Is that good or bad?
Thanks.
So who's he?
Nice.
Stop it, Dil --
You heard me --
It's him, isn't it?
It's Dave.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
She's not a tart.
Not in my experience.
What's it to you?
Where?
Jesus.
Tell me about him.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
Didn't think I could.
Aha.
No...
Dil --
Give it over, Dil --
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
You think that's wise?
I know that.
Ask to meet me again.
So they do know.
Probably.
Are you pretending yet?
Don't be cruel.
Okay.
Kind of.
Anything.
No.
Okay.
I like you, Dil --
Yes.
Love you, Dil.
Anything.
It's my name, Dil --
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
I promise.
Please, Dil --
You know her, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
I heard.
No, what is the thing?
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
You know what. Go.
Was I?
And what happens then?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Would make me feel better about it.
I understand.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Right.
So I've noticed.
Suppose you could say that.
Why did you sign up?
Ever see hurling?
Tree.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I don't know her.
How can I?
What does that mean?
No.
You won't run.
Hurling --
Tell me, Jody
Thought you liked me, bitch.
You're crazy --
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Why do you think I brought you here?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
How do you think I got here?
Relax -- you're gaining.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
With whom? Where?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
No thanks.
His -- real -- ?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Oh, I see.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Were you followed?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Very good.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
No.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
The view had better be worth it.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
Reggie?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Which one are you?
Reggie -- listen to me --
There, you said it.
Cutting it out.
Oh. 
That sounds like their problem.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
No.
Shut the door!
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Well!
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Not unless we're blind.
I don't know anything.
Leave?
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that all? Can I go now?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
I'm Regina Lampert.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Starting tonight?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Having a nervous breakdown.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
A quarter of a million dollars.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
The man you had the fight with.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I don't understa--
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
But what?
I've never seen him before.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What's the matter, chérie?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Daddy you scared me!
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
What's wrong?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
She just turned off her light.
I can.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Who's?
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
I was desperate. It was gross.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
No.
I won't.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
I love you.
Yes?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Attacked how?
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
His mother's side.
I got to go.
What?
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
Yes. Unfair to me.

Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
Borrowed.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
That's...
I ain't playin' that.

Okay.
...you.
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 


Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.

Oh, shit.

So you took his...
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...

Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
...or my conscience.

Huh?
We're gonna die!

Okay.

Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
 
What?
 
Hold this. 
Look out.
Why'd you stay behind?!


...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...about him.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Oh, my God.
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
Three seconds.  One...

And it won't be pleasant. 
We do need your truck.
...-lem too?
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Any of them Richard Long?
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You have my word on that.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
You'll kill us all!
Is this stool taken?
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...you were right, of course.  But after...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Almost quaint.
Forget about him.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
A ruler?
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Do you know him?
Where from?
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
I've got her.
She's fine.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
Could you drive me somewhere?
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Thank you...
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How are you, Lou?
I get by.
Who?
No.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Yes.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
A check?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
I have?
Did you have affairs?
You were seeing someone, too.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
The Valley?
Why?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Your eye.
Just... I have to.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
You bastard.
She's not tied up!
...That's not what I meant.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
To Mexico...
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Oh no.
Okay.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Oh, good.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I'm sorry, I --
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Si.
What about the water?
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
But I have to know.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Yeah, I'll do that.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes. No.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
No, you have a press agent do it.
I'm working for his daughter.
So I can have these? 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
That's right, Modern Times.
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Elena. My name's Elena.
We'll talk about that later.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
Somebody stole it.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Where is he?
Go on!
I can't take shorthand.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
I know.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Yes.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Hello, Bernstein.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Are they standing for me?
Ask them to sit down.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
There is no news big enough.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
Yes, Mr. kane.
It isn't finished?
Has he said when he'll finish?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
You can't stop me.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
It's been a tough day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
I'd like that.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Look out that window.
Why, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
Why is she leaving me?
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Sure.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Good!
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
Am I sure?
You're shittin' me.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
There's no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
You two better quit it.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How like her.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Sang.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Nobody. It was closed.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
I'll assess all I want!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
So I'm told.
Lenin's Tomb.
What's your point?
Peptic ulcer.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Did you tell Veronica?
What do you two fight about?
Your mother.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
What about Veronica?
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Yeah.
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
All of them.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Can we not talk about this?
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
No, you're not.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
If you go, I go.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
What, your dick?
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
You work in a video store!
Let me borrow your car.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
Not yet. 
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Living proof.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
What time did we go to the funeral?
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Fuck you.
As if it's that easy.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Yes.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
They are not.
Yeah.
Yeah?
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
With you? I don't think so.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Veronica.
Meaning?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
No, he got hit by a bus.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Bunch of savages in this town.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Hunhh? Nothing.
She called you, didn't she?
Why do you say that?
Really?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
Including you?
You're a pig.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
I'm serious...
Please calm down.
Something like thirty-six.
Lower your voice!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I love you. Don't feel sick.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
I don't want Caitlin...
I don't want to go back with her...
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
You'll be missed.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Bye. 
Hal will have my head for this.
I admit, I can be bought.
Where's the radio?
What usually eats a banana?
Bags?
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I did what I thought was right.
There wasn't time for anything else.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
One...
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
I don't expect you to understand.
I only came back for you.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Get it!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Never could save a thing.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
Half a day.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Who's going with you?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Ask the questions.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
We can't and he knows it.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Thank you, sir.
Who are they, sir?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Alex.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
I did, sir.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Well - I'm back.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Murder, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Through there for a bath.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
How're you feeling this morning?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Oh.
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
You have, my son.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
What?
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
'Fraid so.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I don't know...
So?  It was a random thing.
Elvis?
Not our call, Phil.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
Try?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
An apology.
It's not that kind of job.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
I don't think I can do this.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
How?
Believe it.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Yeah.
Leave me alone.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
She's in the hospital.
You'd do her a favor.
It's not bullshit.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Why?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
I don't know.
One more.
Then what are you?
Answer the question.
Slow down.
Let her go.
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Why the hell not?
Shut the hell up.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
What is?
Them who?
Yeah.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
You're certifiable.
Believe you about what?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Can you prove any of this?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Is he dead?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
They're big details, Jerry.
Jerry, I --
This way.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You saw me standing alone ...
You knew just what I was there for.
Top pocket...  Go on.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
You've never seen her run.
I'm not sure what you mean.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
You've asked me that one three times.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Yes, that's right.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Wait --
I was just thinking that.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
Ellie?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Tell me.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Ellie.
I don't understand.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Thank you?
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
I can't move any smaller.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
No.  Please.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
That's what they all say.
And?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
It's really happening.
Like it or not.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Make that two.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Can you try?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Yes.  Very much.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
If you came back.
It's getting late...
It's late.  We should go back.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
-- I don't know --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
But --
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Gotta go, Arletta.
You steal a car?
I don't know, Boss.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Hey, Tattoo!
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Pair'a nines.
Get away!
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Forty-five.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Kick a buck.
Well, how far didya get?
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
How about you tryin' to make me?
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
None of your fucking business.
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She don't want it.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
You know I can't do that.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
How do you know that?
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Yes.  I have to go...
Go and look for a note.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Let's get out of here...
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Right.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Yessir.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
You're damn right I do.
Because I think I'm wrong.
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Thank you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
No. But when he's in that car...
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
No.
You could get your wish at any moment.
What?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Please, Letty.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
That's thanks to all your help.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Mom, please.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Green spot.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
No.
By color.
That must be really difficult.
It's magic.
Good God.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Break up?    They wish.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Tell the doctor.
Do you?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Do you like it?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Sounds grim.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
And all the plans we have.
Well then why'd it happen?
You should go.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Sure. Of course.
I'm calling in sick.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Something you did?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
It doesn't matter who.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I start on Monday.
Sure, I understand.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
What does that mean?
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
It's me...
You're calling me on is phone?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
What?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
Thank you.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Cops?
What about the money?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Can I trust you, Sami?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
-- Did you set it up?
We had a deal.
Hard to say.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Oh, I'm sorry.
The Holiday Hotel.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
We've got to get out of here.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
I'm the driver.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Mr. Taylor?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
The hell it is.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
I don't know.
Something like that.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
After last night I could say the same for you.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I do as I please.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Long.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
How so?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Only the sword will settle this.
Kneel!
Give it back!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give me back my comb.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Well, we had talked...
What about you?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
I'm buying.
I knew that.
Don't thank me.
No further.  I'm serious.
You don't say.
I saw it, too.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
Who?
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
I went to see a friend of mine.
She's still dead.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I can see her.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Magic.
Does it hurt?
Your pain ends now.
Shut up.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Kill a dead guy?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Annette Harrison.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
From who?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You did?
A friend wrote me.
It's not really important.
Why are you being so dramatic?
No thank you.
Wait, don't hang up.
Of Human Bondage.
I will.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I do not.
I have feelings for you.
That's not fair.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Get off me.
I love you.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Schwarz. Jewish?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Okay.
I... I don't think you want to know.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... not exactly.
I did?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
You think he'll like it?
Just taking your photo.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Some other time, Cecile.
No.
I know.
I know.
Same time next week?
Who told you?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Who is this?
I told you I don't know.
Ronald?
No.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
What?
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
I see your point... though why should I care?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
I'm aware.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Yippy.
What's your problem?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Mock, mock, mock.
Excuse me?
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
And if I don't?
I'll do my best.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's Cecile.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I've already told you, she's not home.
I'll do that.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
Oh, lots of times.
Do you know the people?
Are they nice?
What's her name?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
What do you mean?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm never unfair.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
I suppose so.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Yes, I did.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It's true.
Voices from an old dark house!
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
You called me by my name.
For as long as you'll let me.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Oh, please!
Don't cry, Amy.
Yes, Amy.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
That's the clever way to do it.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But what happened to the little deer?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Who is she?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Anybody could know that song.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
Come away, Amy.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Can we get some service here?
Never felt better.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Does she have PMS?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Only to see.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Why not? There's been a murder.
No.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Guess she never found true love.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I think I already have.
I guess you'll find out.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
I really gotta pee.
I didn't have to pee then.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
It's Mark.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
Your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Goodnight.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
No, I got it. It's okay.
What's that supposed to mean?
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
I love you too.
They do? Oh no...
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
Worse than this?
Thanks.
No, take it.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Not really...
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
How will we interrogate them?
He's seriously disturbed...
Loose ends?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You are mistaken.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
Who?
Why are they after you?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
What is going on?
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Well...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
That's easy.  You...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry.
A month.
... Alright.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
) Listen, you little...
I can't believe he'd do this.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Bob...
Like how?
Up and around?  Soon?
Exactly. A condition.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Oh.  Excuse me.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Don't do this.
Just what you think I mean.
Sort of... Yeah.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm not sure.
Choices?
Extend things?
Oh, yeah... probably...
I don't think so.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
Fine.
He's not.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
I can't say.
I can't say.
No.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
The Vice-President...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Home.
Oh... Okay.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
I can't.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
I know.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Datura.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
You are dying, too.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
No, sir.
In the battle, sir.
Don't come.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Hey, this is great.
What is the point?
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Except sex.
Garden?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I'm not?
But...
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Doing fine, sir.
Yes... sir.
It's Nuwanda.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Sort of.
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
Dead Poets honor.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Meeks.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
A barbaric yawp.
Yawp!
AHHHHHH!
A madman.
Don't stop!
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I... I just don't want to come.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
It's my birthday.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh. 
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
Yea, art thou there?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Which question is that?
Who asked any?
Then you better start swimming.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Right...
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
No...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
Joey...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
Line it up now, nice and easy...
I have been.
One whistle... Start the engine...
Joey...
Poolside?
A passenger...
Nowhere...
You want some too?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Maybe plans changed...
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
What?
Good... Pass the beer.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
John,we're going huntin'.
We're all going.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
She does not!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
You talk to him?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Where is he???
Yeah?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Inside, Vince.
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Biederman!
Oh... You know...
Would you?
Sure.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
We... Three bullets.
I want to go home, Merle.
Right.
So do I.
Yeah... I guess.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
Hunt with Vince?
What are you, God?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
More bullets in the gun?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Then lemme have 'em.
That's my plan.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Listen, Nick --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
I gotta get back, Nick.
Yeah.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
It's not socks, Sal.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
What's it for??
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up.
What did you say?
Kimberly!
Your mother.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
That wasn't your plan, was it?
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Fine.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Not too good.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Hospital food.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
They always are.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
Thank you, Belle --
And what about Daniel Webster?
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
-- of what happens after we die!
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
I'm through with you.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Not long -- now.
There's no joy in it for me.
Well -- yes --
Who is it?
We can still use my butter money.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Jabez!
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
It's all right, Sheriff.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I won't forget.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Why don't you?
The past six months.
It's okay, it's okay.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Tell me about it.
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
And if he alters it...?						*
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
Who are you, then?
Go fuck yourself.
I'm going to count to three...
When you're hot, you're hot.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Thanks...partner.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
How do you know?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Yes, I would.
What about the kids?
Heidi, I'm dying.
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah.  So how are you?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
Well...
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Why you going to Algeria?
I know I am.  I know!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
You don't have a choice?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
They're okay.
What do you want to know that for?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Call me whatever you want.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's all doped up.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Give me the keys...
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
Well, they go to guard school.
If you take anybody, please take me.
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
Why not?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
I'm glad it's okay.
What about Howard?
Yeah.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
You're serious!
Let's go, Sonny.
Dead or alive?
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Okay, Sonny.
I'm here.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
You follow my car. 
I am.
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
They're beautiful ...
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
How much?
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
What?
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
Yes.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
That's the rumor on the street.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

He used to date Pat Benatar!
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
I was a musician.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
<i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i>
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Do you know where Danang is?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
In theory.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Have you noticed something about them?
You the man.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
What was you saying?
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
I've done that before.
OK.  OK.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I'm working.
Stop tripping.
You are too crude.
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Don't worry about it.
What is?
Can ya dig it?
Talk to your son.
I got no say over people.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Can't do.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Come in then.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Then we'll do something else.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
It's 'pose to be cold.
I am a man.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
That's what I think.
We're outta here.
He's right.
On the rebound.
HATE!
He's nuts.
I love you.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
You listening to me?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Yeah, I think.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
In the new library there.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Four colors? Neato!
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I'm fine.
Coming.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
You're it.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
She did not.
Shut up!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
They can't be real.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Put some ice on it.
Our own special bus.
Yea!
You can't marry my mom.
You're always your harshest critic.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
No. What happened?
Who?
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
That must be her boyfriend's car.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I lugged it all over town!
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Roger that, Wilco.
Right.
Damn! What are the odds?
That's the one I wanted.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Not to expect you tonight.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're just jealous.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Looks like the best man won.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Do we have a deal?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
And I you.

Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.

They tried and died....  Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
No.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Thank you.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
The <u>women</u>?
I never thought of that.
I am always on time.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
That's good.  I could use the money.
Dracula?
I didn't feel well...
I never said I could ad-lib...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don't know.  Where?
And who may you be?
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Ed, it was only one review.
Better than not getting a job?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
You met Basil Rathbone!
This is my way of telling you --
Toss us out on our ass.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
I told you this was gonna happen.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Da pleasure be mine.
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Um, I guess --
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
I am.  How's your father?
Not good...
I just picked them up on the way over...
Huh?
No! I love sex with girls.
STOP!
Bela died.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Well you tried --
Uh, atomic energy?
Dynamite --
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
What's uncanny?
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
What octopus motor?
I do.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Do they show it?
Yeah. Ma...
Who?
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Yes!
I'm moving out.
You're nuts.
What?
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Mm...  Oh, man...
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Who?
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
When? Today?
He made a mistake.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Oh my God!
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Shari, Ray feels --
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Well, when you put it that way.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Really? 
So?
Are you all right?
The what?
What?
What did you do to your hair?
Thumbsucker!
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Ray --
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Me?! That's you!
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Ed... I'm sorry.
What?... Why?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
That's the point -- this could change things.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
pierdes.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Dick... Dick,..
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Hey, that's super
Sure
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
That sounds good.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Would you sign it for me?
Take as much room as you want
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Walt needs to see you.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
I did it.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Dave.
Still clear?
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
What do you mean?
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
I'm not like you.
For what?
For what?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What's it to you?
Are you sorry she's dead?
It's Bud.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
How?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
What are you talking about?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
What was that boyfriend's name?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Let's just kill them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
<u>Lynn</u>.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
I don't know him.  Mr...
Of course...
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
What little studio?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
I don't have time.  I have --
Believed what?
I don't own no shotguns.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
White's a mindless thug.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
What?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Why?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Yeah, it's subtle.
What's wrong, Trash?
And no one'll know about this?
Yes.
I'm telling you, I--
You're not.
Listen to me--
Listen--
Rachel Banks?
Told by whom?
Yeah.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
We said a hundred.
They come after you?
Looks like Detroit.
Yeah.
You sure?
Those are Feds.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell me about it.
What about newspapers and magazines?
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if--
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
Not particularly, no.
Oh my God.
Eight.  Size eight.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
I can't.
Somebody took my blender.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
I saw a man die.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
Yeah.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
How could you let me find out like this?
I see her for business.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Yes.
That's okay.
That was for Christmas.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
Yeah.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
You're not.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
I'm sorry about that.
Yeah.
We believe he did.
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Brill.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Hi, dad.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Where's mom?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
Did they take your clothes?
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Table 122?
Into what?
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
To the cops?
Jerry?
How can I reach you?
The police?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Get it.
Hiding something?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
He's clever. He had help.
I just meant--
We believe?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
What kind of fossils?
Excuse me?
As the wife of one of our party.
What do you mean, poetry?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
You will.  You will.
What?
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
Yes.  Absolutely.
I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Still a car.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
What?
Her hands and feet were tied.
In my room.
Okay.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Don't cut me.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I don't know what that means.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
And you've forgotten yours.
Very true!
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Are you remembering more?
Are you crazy?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Your friend?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Would you like me to?
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Of course.  When?
He can't even move.
Hello miss.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
A bit of one.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Through a window.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Who am I?
Uh. I'm showing off.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Uh, yes.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
No. Why would I be?
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
It was perfect.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
We are...for the tools.
Yes you did.
Thank you.
To our...partnership.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
In eye of that painting.
You're not on the beat.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Got it.
There is no big job.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Okay, 80-20--
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Where the money is.
And the money goes--
A parting gift from the Empire.
You've thought of everything.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Surgically attached.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
What about you?
My god--
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
This better be worth 1t.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You're giving them to me?
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
Who?
Yes?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Yeah.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
So you think we got 'em scared?
Erin --
It's not about working hard --
I know how DNA works, Erin --
And that's what caused the contamination?
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
No shit.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Really?  It makes me sick.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Yesterday.
Corey.
Did he say why?
What do you mean?
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
There's more than one kind?
Have you been to the water board?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
So did I.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
We'll see.
I'm gonna go live with George.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
You got a little girl?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Keep your voice down.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
What's that?
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
You did?
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Come in, Admiral.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
I can help them!
You won't.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I'm going to see what it is.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
What was it?
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Probably an asteroid field ....
Good.
Now you're making sense.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
The entrance is collapsing!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Never heard of that system.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Who's staring?
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
I always said you were a gentleman.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
You're part of the mining guild then?
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
That sounds familiar.
I understand.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Well, what now?
Let's go.
What are you talking about?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
No! .... Never ....
Never.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
I want that ship.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They're...pretending to dress.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
And we can watch ...
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You told me he was dead.
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Dream on, blue eye.
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
A medical team will be standing by.
It's history. I gotta go.
So where's Plissken?
No way.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Which way?
The what?
Thank God.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I gave up my castles and my lands!
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Of Merlin?
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Rise, Mordred.
Ye...
Because you and the land are one.
No.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
He has given up.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
People make you laugh?
Why?
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well what's wrong?
I didn't know that.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh great, anything else?
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
I can't believe it.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Please.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
What's her name?
Really? wow.
I just heard them Karl.
Karl!!
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Pretty close.
Sure did.
That depends.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Could you see her?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
No.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
When can I have one?
I found it.
The closet
Here I'll show you.
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
But you like him.
How do you know?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
So what's next?
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
Stealing is a sin.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Sure.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Uh Huh.
But deliver us from the evil one.
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Yeah, a fall.
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes?
Are you a relative?
Swimming trunks.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Baker.
How will he eat?
Oh.
Accident?
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
What's the point?
Lotta water.
Fuck him.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Thanks.
It's more than that.
I don't gotta go.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
She'll get here.
I'll take my chances.
You wanna get a drink?
So what do you think?
Last?
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
A few bars!
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Two hours ago!
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
What are you talking about?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
February?
He was just having fun.
I can't make the tenth.
I don't know. Some disease.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
We're finished.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
When we know.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What's wrong with it?
They're nines.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Baker's unabridged.
Great.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Huh?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How do you know?
Must've been a cheap date.
So how's the cat food business?
Another five years, huh?
Is that what you used to do?
Merry Christmas.
Huh? Oh, no.
... Thanks.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Yeah -- me.
Drive.
My place.
Should be.  It's yours.
How old is he?
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
Is that what you think?
Something good?
So you had a nightmare.
One last time.  It's important ...
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Five seconds.
Shoot him!
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
That's your name, isn't it?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What?
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Gone?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Great.
-- Studying.
You?  Married?
So you left her?  Just like that?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
What’s going on here?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Big Ed’s.
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Ringing my bell...
It’s just two kids, right?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
So could you write down her exact address?
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
I’ve got all the time in the world...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
What the hell is happening to me?!
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
I don’t think so, thank you...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Need a nurse?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
You hear me complaining about that?
I don’t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  But this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do what?
She got those shoes...
Really.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
If you want to look at it that way...
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
I want it...
It’s good, right?
That’s a big one for me, too.
I’ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Do I know you?
Okay, I’ll take them...
Is there anything I can do for you?
Of course I did.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
This makes five.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Is it safe?
Victor must've taken him.
And they're changing into...
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Dude.  That's my sister.
And if he's not...?
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Hilarious.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Never better.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
It's been changed.
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
Are you kidding?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And reverse the mutations --
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
You <u>were</u>?
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
No...
The less time, the better.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
And take a little trip with them...
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Yes?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
You may learn to like it.
But I did. I'm positive!
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
I feel much better now...
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
Then why not take it?
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
What about Dr. Michaels?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
Two in a row?
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Where we going?
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
On the Repeater.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Where's my daughter?
Certainly.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
No.
Whoa, Daddy.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Oh, he's adorable.
Uh-huh.
Oh sure.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Chaska.
And what about the other fella?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Ya kiddin'!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, I see.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Okay.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Yah.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Uh-huh.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah?
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
I'm sorry, Mike.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
I always liked ya so much...
Margie Olmstead?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
What'd he say?
His wife?
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yah.
Three-cent stamp.
It's terrific!
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Congratulations, Jerry.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Should we?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Goodbye.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Nothing.
No... no problem.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Answer the question!
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Don't ask.
What?
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Pardon me?
No, supply oxygen?
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
There's always that.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
You get the idea.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Anyone?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Good answer.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Okay.
It isn't... ?
Homework assignment.
Tell him!
Hey.
What should I have told you?
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
I want to know --
What are you doing?!
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
What... what are you saying?
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
I'm not going...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
What?
Defuse the bomb, please.
I think this is about where we came in.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
I swear on my life, I won't...
You told me you'd say that.
You and your friend.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
No, please, no, God, no!
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Taken care of.
We need to hurry.
Carter.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Take my van!
I've got to stop and help those people.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Sure.
Who am I, David Blane?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Yeah?
He's not a witch.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Why do you think I was hiding?
No!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
No one's that strong.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
No.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
There's the Mekong.
No.
Show me how it operates.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Read you.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
There are no worse places.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
You comin'?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Let's get that tent down!
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Not yet.
What's the plan?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Those men are all dead.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
You threw him out?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Why this is outrageous!...
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Thank you very much.
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I... I was just leaving.
Yes... I... I agree...
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Sshhhh!
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Parry!
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Who?
I know!
I don't like horror movies!
It sounds exciting.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
You don't have to say that.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Divorced.
Twinky?
A wig?
You said.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Out where?
You got another ball comin'.
I'm not.
I'm not some piece a crap.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Washington.
I didn't get it, did I?
No. How much do I owe you?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Don't, then.
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I don't know.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
That's dangerous, you know.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Then after that?
The day after tomorrow.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
None.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
What?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
All right, let's have a rematch.
You're all full of shit!
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Well, she was.
So get the fuck outta here.
Is it true?
Hi.
I just wanted to see you.
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Wussup, Victor.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
She fucks it all up!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Pitt.
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
For real?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Yeah.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
What?
So, then whadda ya want?
Unbelievable.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
I have no idea.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
We play tennis at the club.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Your aunt?
Well, which one?
Funny old bird.
Oh, he was dying for years.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Gum thought Brazil.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Thank you.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
You may be right.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Whoops.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Oh, about ten days ago.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
You sure did.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Charmed.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Where am I going?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Nothing to it.
You've met her?
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
John! You used to fly together!
You are a rich woman.
Hi.
I saved his life during the war.
No. He was. I got him out.
It's amazing.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
He never sees them and I never met them.
What is this?
Why did you do it?
Yeah.
How do you know about that?
What does all this mean?
But I've seen the deed.
Act natural.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You shouldn't be here.
In her cabana, sir.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Lock's busted.
What?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'd say charcoal.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
Who's your decorator?
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Exactly.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Make eye contact when you say that.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Fluck you!
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ye-ah.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Really?
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Go on, another time, another place.
Only on a first name basis.
What?
No - no.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Who's this --
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
What happens to the schedule?
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Where from?
What's he do?
Morning.  Sometime.
He coulda been white.
Give who a tail?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Yeah.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Four.
Hiya, Jesus.
For garbage?
Well, I think you do.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Wish you weren't.
Okay...
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Frank, please...
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Huh?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What's happening?
I don't know.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
1998.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I never knew you, Dad.
It did, Pop.  It did.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
You really wanna know?
I'm right here, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Uh, huh.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Sounds good.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
She's pretty special.
I hear that.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I don't know...
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I vote for me.
Barely.
Chuck... look.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Will you come with me?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Sort of.
Keep looking.
Maybe.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Don't say any more.
I have to.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Uh...yes.  But...
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
I found it outside.
Why?
But what I get scared again?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Yes, but they released me because...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Yes.
The what?
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
It's going.
Okay, I'll call you later.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
For a good reason.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
That's all right.  I was just...
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Oh my God, Steven.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
You don't know shit!
-- Bad?!
I mean really never.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
It's...dead.
The fire alarm...
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Oh dear God...
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
What about not-so-great writers?
I'd love to.
Where are they?
Is the ship going to sink??
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Alla puttanesca.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Then you should carry a gun.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Paisley Porter.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
You know about Adele.
Can he get through it?
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
That's completely crazy.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
How prominent?
Who the hell cares?
That's always been my problem.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
This could be it!
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Since when did that matter?
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Matthew's my grandson.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Because faith is rewarded.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Sidney.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I hear good things about the new play.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I don't know.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
As I told you about English policemen.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
He said he's in charge...
I thought you were against fighting.
We must end the campaign.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
You will respect the law.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Hm.  Is it?
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I --
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
It's split the Government.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Somehow I expected not.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
He's "discovering" India.
Er, no...
Not yet, I'm afraid.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
A man's dead, Detective.
Grudges?
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Where did you get this?
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Jerome--?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Again?
Six one.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
You know I'm scared of heights.
It's okay, Eugene.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Michael's.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Antonio, the choir...
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
No.
You celebrate, Jerome?
What exactly is wrong?
Of course.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Come on.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
I can't do this.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Antonio--
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Yeah.
Better than old times.
Just the way I remembered.
Fatter... some things never change.
I'm still here, Doc.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Want to cry now?
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
At least you were outside.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
When are you going to learn?
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Let's do it.
El Paso.
Not now.
No scars.
I don't want to hear it.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
I'll be ready.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Who was it?
Pull over.
Where?
What about you?
I'm good at that.
Aren't we going a little hard?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
I kinda doubt it.
What's it to you?
You serious?
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
I know.
How?
Who?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Was the steering faulty?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
What about?
Christ, what...
That's nice.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Doreen.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Once a week?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
Really?
No. I didn't know that.
We're there now.
Especially when I play the lead.
Sure I'm sure.
You've been watching the film.
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
How many?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
I see.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
You sure?
My brother, Frank.
No. Really, I am.
Ta-ra.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
Pension him off.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Still got your sense of humour.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yes.
The gun he means.
They do that up North.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That's right, Harry.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
I had to.
Mmm...
Well, I think I had one once.
And now...
Some contest board...
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...cower in his boots...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
I heard that they were running cold.
What act?
That's right...
When they...
What do you mean?
Yes...?
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Talking about it as a...
Well.  Well...
Not actually, no.
We are?
You're saying "me."
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
Why would I do it?
No.
Yes.  I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
Absolutely.
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Is that what I just said?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Uh-huh.
What?  You can't do any what?
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
No.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
You understand?
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
You...
We had a robbery. 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Would you excuse us, please.
Levene!!
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
You're done, come down, and let's...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Get in the goddamn room.
You know what those leads cost?
The leads are assigned randomly...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Because I say so.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
I...
That was easy, wasn't it?
Mmm.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
That's right.
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Sure.
Home cooking...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
Me.
My wife...
Three days.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I don't have the power.  I said it.
This.
She told me not to talk to you.
It's nothing.
They didn't get my contracts.
The...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
If you don't want it, give it back.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
I got lots of presents.
I can't.
To do business.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
I got surprises for everybody!
I saw him with you.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Tom is right.
The children can stay.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
But if you're wrong...
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
I don't know.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
That plane goes to Miami...
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Very well.
Yes, Michael, it does.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
The baby I lost...
Who's asking?
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
No, I'm fine.
Let him gamble.
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
They feel cheated.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I thought we would meet alone.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
And?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got friends in the commission.
What was that?
Just thinking out loud.
Weird.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
But I didn't do this!
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Huh?
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
But why?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
This David's a friend?
Can't today.
I'm not, you know.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
No.  I --
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Not at the moment.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Cut it out!
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Something happened to him?
Clayton is fine.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Do I have any other choice?
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I'm very sorry.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
All right.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Ooooh.
I just want to watch it, okay?
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
You didn't, Jimmy.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Go.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
What rumors might those be?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Righto.  Let me see.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Is there someplace we can talk?
Jesus ...
Point-five ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You got no choice. It's over.
How is he?
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
No...
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Your girl works in there ...
Needs brightening ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
Keys were in it ...
Donny-nothin'!
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
You know where the others are?
It's arright ...
There's no one left ...
one minute -- !
How's Kip?
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
Mother -- !
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What am I supposed to do?
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Yeah -
Okay --
Hey, now -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
What?
I know. I've missed you, too
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Hospital.
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
On account of me.
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
What's wrong with her -- ?
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No way ...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Cut 'em...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
And Tracy's on the move ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Hello, Otto ...
I'll see you soon --
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Checkin' it out
Billy, how are you?
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
No more shines, Billy.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
How much?
That again.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
It'll be okay.
I can't do it anymore.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Jimmy.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Nah.
I can't make any more deliveries.
You're some fucking jerk.
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
--or a tail--
Stop crowdin the plate!
Next week.
Gone.
You don't know that.
No, I had to talk him down.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
This is your house, right?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Shut up.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Good, it was all right.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
--But--
Which one's your building?
What're those?
That's right.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
Since Nancy died.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Five.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I been here a couple years.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
I don't know. India maybe.
What's the point?
There is somebody...
I don't got a crush on her.
Hold up.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
What did you think?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
No.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
--Well, maybe that means you.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
You're not going to fail me are you?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'm Will.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
They don't come over here that much.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Some, a little.
How do you know that?
And you're sure about that?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I can't go out to California.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
What am I scared of?
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don't want to hear that.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Joad.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Got a warrant?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Say, who runs this place?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
That's our place.
I never heard nothin' about it.
I don't know.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Yeah.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Naw--not much!
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
What you mean?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
No'm.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
She'll be awright.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
I'm ready.
Granma's dead.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Then what, Tom?
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
There, them stripy ones.
Are you crazy?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Won't they come out here?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Me an' you both.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Morning.
In the corporate offices.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
What?
Really...? So what?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
You see someone?
What's that?
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
I just know.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
You understand the psychology of the job.
Up on the right.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Excellent. Here they come.
Those all seem kind of related...
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
One cannot love and kill.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I spoke to your father the other day.
Paul?
He sold me this bad boy.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
See you in ten years.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
When I was first married.
A jogger, huh?
You too.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
It is. It's lovely.
I am comfortable.
Tom.
The point was to love each other.
Fine!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
No, you just act like you do.
Don't they believe in signs here?
You already did.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
I'll take care of it.
About what?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
So do you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Exactly...
All right. Speak to you then.
Yeah. Bye.
Tch. What are you --
No, let me go.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Everything all right.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
About what?
I don't understa-
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Yes, it does.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
You!
Yeah.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
He thought it was a ghost.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
So?
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Maybe... look -- just...
You just showing off for her!
Oh yeah...
We still have a way to go.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Sometimes.
Now that's cool.
It's cool!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Super hero like even.
That's far out!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
...as they snoop onto us.
It was him, man!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Curtis.
Mm-hmm.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
What's this one eat?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
We did it!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
I said give me time.
You're not gonna win.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Uh, hold on...
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I didn't know what was on it.
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Dreams?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Homicidal?
What's happening?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Joey, Joey...
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Congratulations.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Real charmer.
I don't know Brady.
No, you don't understand.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
She's not dead!
What does that mean?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm not calling the fire department.
How many bodies did you find?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
I can't sleep.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
Coming.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Jamie?
Its not over yet.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
What are we doing?
Got it Ben.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Car trouble?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
I have a place for that.
Look where?
The guys think I'm too smart.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
He was watching me.
He can still watch.
Thanks.
What's this big, big news?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Yeah.
Could have...
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I found the car! He's here!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Same time, same place.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure. Sure.
I don't like that story.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
After the movie.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
I killed him...
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
What makes you think we're more interesting?
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, great.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, God.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Everything's okay? 
Yeah.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Why?
Oh, my God.
No.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I don't know.
You're not lost.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
That thought doesn't terrify you?
No, nothing.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Yeah.
They're in the basement.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
No.
Yeah.
Like what?!  What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Why?
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I got two minutes.
Huh?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Thanks, thanks.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
I should get a garter belt.
Singing?
Well-well, like what?
Hmm!
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
No!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Yeah?
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Yeah.
Come on.
Really?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Hmm.
Yeah.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, well.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, who cares?
Just a few minutes ago.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
April?
Hmm.
...read it over, and think about it.
They're offering... 
It's a growth business.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn't you help us?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
You want me to be?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
M'I gonna see you tonight?
I know her by the Back.
...would you excuse me...?
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Show me the Pigs.
Have the child taken to bed.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I've never heard that he...
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
....what...? 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
Said what?
How's your <u>child</u>?
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Spoken like a Protestant.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
...yes, yes, yes....
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
...no.
What is your point?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Yes.
...yes...?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.

I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Say Hi for me.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...

Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Hey, don't run away now.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Heather? Wha...
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
How very.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
S'okay....
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Incredible similarity.
Oh.
You must have had fun.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Remember he's left-handed.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did not.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
May<u>be</u>.
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
Get a job.
What's that?
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
Saint Mario!
It's so beautiful!
You mean travel by ourselves?
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
All right, then.
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Your wife...?
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
All finished.
Bull...
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
What?
How much time off?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Ambrose. I know.
I said she's been missing for-
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
A little? Try unbelievably.
I don't work here.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Right.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
Me!
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Vietnam!
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Unprofessional.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
What?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
How are they with kids?
They're really white.
That would be stupid.
Yeah, that was easy.
Just show me the way.
It's a living.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
About us.
Did Daddy tease you?
Holly -- that's not so.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Here, take this out to the table.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
What?
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
What?
Oh -- great.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
I'm having the floor fixed,
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Shut up.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
And I can't help having a cold.
Get on the other side of that.
Even cosier.
No joke, Lieutenant.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
What is it?
I think it was England.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
It's circumstantial.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
A few days ago.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
That's all?
Me?  Of course.
She's the King's cousin.
That doesn't matter.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I lied.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
What are you hoping to find inside?
You got me.
I'll be fine.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
About what?
I'm interested in mythology.
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
I wanted to get to know you better.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
Not unless they're immortal.
It will end tonight.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
How could they get by him?
What's that next to him?
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
I know, Paul.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Why did you wait?
I can take care of myself.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
I'll no forget you.
Yes.
Fine.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
My dreams died long ago.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
I can take care of myself.
Yes, sir.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
What do you want to do?
I'll make the call.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
It's happening right now.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
I'm going to my desk.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Okay.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Use more ice.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Dennis.
We can't make the microwave work.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
How about dog shit?
Mars?  What are you doing?
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
He said something about a girl --
Just one question.  Please.
Another minute.  Please --
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Yes, sir.
Special Agent Jones.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
In my room.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Who is it?
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
I guess we do.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Of course.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
Let me explain.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Their people?
Satellites?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
How so.
At least.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Promoted. House Manager.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
One thousand francs.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
I couldn't help.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
So where is the lamb?
You cannot go alone.
Yes.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
There is one thing I need right away.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Why?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
The lieutenant wants the register.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
The staff, the guests.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Can I help you?
And what's Steven's status?
So what stopped her?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Yes.
What?
And we get this money when?
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Why?
I don't think so...
No...not air --
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Let's try down here...
He's dead...?
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- the sadistic prick --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
What?
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
-- confirming everything we already know --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
The lockdown thing.
-- it wasn't me.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Believe me, we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
He would have been back by now.
Over here.
Keep talking, I'll find you!
What's the matter?
What was her name?
It might have been her mother.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Suppose not.
Yes.  It was.
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Well I bet you they're happy.
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
I'm ok mommy.
My God, I heard something!
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
What?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Are you ok?
I think everything's ready.
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
What?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
White meat will be fine...
Why?
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Come back to us honey!
And you...are?
Good night.
The amulet...
It will not take long...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
We'll be there.
Well what is it!
Jesus Christ ...
I know what I saw.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
So where is it?
Where?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Who's that?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Wow.  Thank you.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Not quite.
Really?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
Don't worry, we'll get it...
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
You're supposed to be dead!
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Never, why do you ask?
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Actually he never told us what it was.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
What job?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Too bad.
Sharp.
The Hipster!
The Hudswinger!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm plenty happy!
Yeah.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
He didn't offer you money.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
-- or lack thereof?
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
I don't know...
Says who?!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Norville.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Well, I made the dean's list.
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
She's damn good, Lou.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
That's nonsense, Alma.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
I like her already.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
Did you hear what he sang?
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Of course not!
And charming?
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Good morning.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
You didn't drive her mad.
She was beautiful.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Yes.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
To the asylum?
Why?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
So maybe you'll come too?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
That shirt?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Stuffed and baking.
You think I --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
In the car.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Elena.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
The phone's out.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Hnnn.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Birth control.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Huh?
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Mom. Are you ok?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It's really quite all right.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Am I right or am I right?
Major.
Let's see!
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Who said so?
Out.
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
Wendy!
Yeah.
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Can I come?
With who?
Are you his girlfriend?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Huh?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Actually...
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Twelve years younger.
Okay.
Then change it.
Why?
No.
What?
Even the best make mistakes.
You know what about.
To do nothing.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Will?
I'm always all business.
Huh?
Huh?
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
The other guy?
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Thought you wanted something fun...
I said you're going to get a phone call.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
He.  Well, he...
Told you I could write an ending.
This an accident, Walter?
No back-up.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Then there is nothing.
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Listen to me.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
No.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Claudia - don't -
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
How devilishly clever.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
And no one knows but us...
Be still!
Never.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Yes...
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Yes...
The crucifix -
Fascination...
I can't.
I don't know any hell -
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
No...
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
No...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yet. Nothing yet.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Yes.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
What do we do?
Why are you being like this?
Will you try...for me, please?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
You know me to well.
Fine. Show me the body.
Who?
I'm fine.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
I'll talk real slow.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Good winds and bad winds!
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
My friend -- what can one say --
They were gore before I came here.
All the graves?
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor Cathy --
I was looking for you.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
My last name is Pherides.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Miss Wollsten!
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
We have no time for that.
How did she die?
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can't.
He hates all my race.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Made what?
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Yes, George?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
What's that book you've got there?
I know. I know.
Thanks.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
All in . . .
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Came back three days ago.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Hmmm?
Yes, sir.
No.
Aw, get going!
No. No.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Have a good time, son.
Say, where's Mother?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Vi.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Right down here.
Hello?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
I don't like coconuts.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
In that place?
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I'm going to scream!
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Would you rather leave?
Well, then, sit down.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
My baby.
Going up to see Zuzu.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Sure, sure I am.
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
Stop paddling!
We better go back in.
That's awful.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
We're hung up on something.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
You bet.  Hang on....
The rope!  The rope!
Can you get us a line?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
It's still there!
Happy to do it.
Right.
Please.  It's my job.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
What else you got?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
My ass!
What's that supposed to mean?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
In the den.
For me?
Damn.
Terrific.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
It was bad, wasn't it.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Going out.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Now I really want to see it.
Waiting for Andy.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
That's a crock of shit.
Shut up.
Huh?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Yeah.
Len, can I see you a minute?
Forget it, he won't listen.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
With those camera lights and...
They're acting very strange suddenly.
I guess.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Get out of here!
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Hi, baby.
They just wanted to say hello.
Nothing.
Make up your mind.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Yes.
I know I can capture it.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No.
How's your patient?
What's up?
I can't take water, Kathryn.
It's a shark's tooth!
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
We're taking that shark alive!
Still sleeping.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
Don't blame yourself.
How you doing, Kelly?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
I don't know, it depends.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Depends on big brother.
And alone.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No, think of something else.
Now what's this do?
SEAN!
Now what?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Yeah, poor bastard.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
No way.
Always do.
Got a job for me?
Sharks???
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Who's grown up?
We're in love.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
But you always let me....
Yes, I did.
He told me you both did....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Tell Matt he should be here....
Because....
They're at the beach....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I can't help it....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
What's going on?
Thank you....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You just got here....
There's nothing to worry about....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
It's wonderful....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
You're not going to bet it all....
No!
Good.  I have two left....
That's hard to imagine....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
My vision is perfect....
Just like that?
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
She said it was coming....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Stop busting my hump....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
The females have eggs....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Put me down....
Where the hell's the beer...?
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Down here....
Gave them the day off....
When I signed on....
So did I....
Hoagie.
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Just trying to be helpful....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Only me and Mom ..
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
O.K.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Pay me, and I shut up.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
To throw out of the window.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I'm going up to the institute.
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
I guess by the bed.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
You ain't going in alone?
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
No.
Once.
That's bullshit,
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
Yes.
Which is what?
No I'm not.
It's not possible right now.
Why does he want to kill me?
I can't identify him ..
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I'm blind because my father drank.
I wanna be near you ...
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Ugh!
Okay, this is working.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
-- stop --
No.
No.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
You're imagining it.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Same to you.
Hello?
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Good.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Please, if I start talking --
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
I'll give it everything.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Call me tomorrow.
Oh my God.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
No, you're --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Fine.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
How sad --
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
Can you be quiet?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
Quiet!
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
Nothing.
No, it's...
Eric!
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
Where is it?
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Baryonyx?
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Yeah.
Then we go home?
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
This plane can not land!
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Minimal.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Piss.
Why?
Piss.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
It has a broken leg!
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
I don't know.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Why did you come here?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Are you insane?!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
What?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
No.
JUMP!
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
You're sure we have to?
Damn!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Where did the vehicles stop?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Look.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
The Cretaceous.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Dilophosaurus.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
The other car!
I don't know.
They're not here.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
I get ah - -
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Oh, yeah - - great.
No.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
I doubt it.
"Thunder lizard!"
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You want to talk about this?
I didn't say I was scared.
I know.
You're sure?!
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
That was great!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
_Krueger_...
Come on.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
None of that's true?
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Great.	When can you do it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
What was the matter with it?
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I'll commit that to memory.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
One of you must be mistaken.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Usually.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Eight -- and seven months.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
You look tired.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Amerika for us!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
It's ... lovely.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
No!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
That's too bad.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
I'd just be guessing.
You think people hate you.
No, that's not --
Here please.
Yes -- all right --
Will you let me go then?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Mm.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Most of them.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
OK.
No thanks.
I go on rounds.
No, I said what did you think.
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
How?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
We did this before.
I don't like getting splashed.
I was wondering what that was.
Trask wants to talk with you.
You're going back?
I believed her, Pete.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Someone's been doing all these things.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
She told me.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Yes sir, we know he --
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Playing.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Soon.  Very soon.
Wow!  French toast, really?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
You got a letter from mom.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
I guess...
Uh huh...
I'm allergic to onions.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No!
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Yeah?
Sure.
Sure.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Why does he decide?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Then I have concluded my questions.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Yes.
No.
No.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
I don't know...
You've been living here, in the city?
Joanna, I don't give a--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Six.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
Look, Ted, all I--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Got it.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Khambas are wild men.
Cow.
Here. We'll collect them.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
I will not approve it.
All?
I am afraid.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
We do not know.
I accept it. What is suffering?
Answer. 
You could buy them.
Please.
When it is time.
Look here!
And, America?
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
Good day.
Thank you.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
I have smarter men.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
What would you do, Holiness?
It is a difficult situation.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
A spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
That hurt my feelings.
I never had sex with you!
What's going on?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Never been to Maine before?
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I'd be able to see something.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Night.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
I heard something.
Good idea.
You wouldn't?
Keep firing!
Take him.
He heeds a tourniquet.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Likewise.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
So does he.
You too.
I can look at dead things.
Yes.
You talk to the married couple?
It's just that--
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
<u>Apologize</u>?
I asked you to be nice to him.
You like Jack?
She's worried about the cow now.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kelly--
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Wild guess.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
He's here, Ardelia.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
I understand.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Starling -
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Starling -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
I didn't.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Mmm. And what else...?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Killed outright?
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No! That's incidental.
All right, then tell me how -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes...
Yes. I'll tell you.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Let us go, miss.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
I'm sorry.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
And by sea!
"Some"?
Yes. Yes, I will.
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
No.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Ottawa!
Your enemy...
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
You're not coming with us?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Webb's at Edward?
The decision is final.
Atten-hut!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Yes.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Be my guest.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What?...
What dead one on the ship?
Can you fix it?
No.
I got hung up!  Try this!
Shit...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Where's Jones?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
It bit me!
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Ahhhh!
And it killed Bo?
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Beautiful.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Not yet.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
I'm going to kill it!
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Under there?
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
DeJesus...It's got him.
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Oh man, that's just great...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Right.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Well what?
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
About twenty minutes.
Furry muff, let's go.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
. . . What?
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Get your fingers out of my soup!
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
How the fuck should I know?
Oh, come on, Amado--
So?
They're not going to jail.
I can fix cars.
I'm sorry, sir.
I-I can do the job, sir.
I am, sir.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. Not at all.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
I'm feeling okay--
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
That badge--
Yeah.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
That's in Maverick County.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Do I seem jumpy?
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
What?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
So that's him--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
No sir.
But they were Indians themselves.
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Dad--
Cool.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Maybe.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
We should just do it.
Pleased to meet you.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Have we had trouble there before?
That's where he fell.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Protection?
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We was crossin' the river--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
You go by your old house?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We have a murder?
Do you?
And the ten thousand?
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Of course you can.
For a while.
I only went for my last two years.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
So I've heard--
Well, you were working there--
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Are you okay?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Yeah.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Two years.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
The shooter local?
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Sure.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
You going to tell him?
Who is he?
You heard right.
Nope.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Knew what?
Deep shit?
He won't.
Why did you wait so long?
What is he?
Yes.
Harry.
Do you?
You haven't seen anything yet.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Yes.  You do that.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Some or it.
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
I'm here, Harry.
I think so.
Harry-?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
He got up and walked.
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Fuck you.
Are you a gambling man?
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
A ticket home,
I'm afraid she's not in.
Yeah, I know.
No.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Does anybody?
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Not much.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
He deserved it.
It's me betrayed him.
And you're not?
And you believed him?
He's better off this way.
Fuck you.
Not true.
Yes.
Yes.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Oh.
Philosophy.
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, you smiled.
You're possessive.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
That's ok.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
A coke.
Yes, no.
Oh?
Yes?
Yes?
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
What?
Fine. Is it going ok?
Bye.
Sure.
It'll just be a few days.
Sure.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's probably trivial.
What happened?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
What time did you make it for?
It's nothing.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
My secretary?
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
He will.  He has great faith.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
What's his name?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
What's the...OH SHIT!
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
We're going to do this.
What are these?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Not a lot.
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Nothing.  So good luck.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
How is he?
Don't curse.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
She's alright.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
You're cold?
Uh-huh.
It's okay.
Four days.
To do what you love.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Oh, great.
Yeah, right.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Just not my type, I guess.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't care.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
I don't.
Who's Spalding?
Would you watch the damn road?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
With a jacked-up attitude.
He ain't Spalding.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
What?
Yeah.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
You do see me standing here, right?
Quit.
Plan to.
You're not stupid.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Hey, what's up.
Cheap date.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Oh yeah?
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
So you're gonna bitch up?
Business folks.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
What?
Tell me what?
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
What?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Oh that's good.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm coming!
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
What's that stand for?
If you're not here for a 422 --
Good bye.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
What?
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Son, don't --
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
What happend?
You're a friend of the family I presume?
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Gently, son --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Yes I do.
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
You do?
Where is he?
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
Yeah.
I've seen it before.
Graduation?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Like I said, yeah --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Yes.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
Go ahead and waste your time.
He passed away.
...are you Phil...?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
About three weeks ago.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Mmm.
I don't think, he can't...
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
No one else in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
What's this, how did this happen?
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
All your other fluzzies?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula --
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
As fast as I can.
Love you too..
No one else that I know?
How long with Paula?
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
No they don't --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
mmmhmm.
Yeah.
Yes. What? Yes.
That's pretty cool.
Maybe.
Should be one-thirty.
Love you too.
Sure.
Go to bed.
It's ok.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
This happens....this is something that happens.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
May I speak with you?  Alone?
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Those can be adopted --
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Yes, and he has a choice!
But -- what is he doing?
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
Everyone back.
Forgiveness?
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
What use am I?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
He lures us to capture.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
Perhaps this will help.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I know.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
How did you know -- ?
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
... You knew you had a double?
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Forgive?!
I must insist, Sire.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Yeah?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
So what?
You set to go -
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
You're the mysterious type, right?
No...
You'll find out - soon enough.
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I knew I could count on you.
How about Marvosa and the others?
Both at the same bank...
Hop in.
Screw him!
Then what did you do, play canasta?
That's when it happened?
Could he handle a direct contact?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
How are Molly and the boy?
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
When do they go to press?
Not the Bible?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I am all right.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
No other possibilities?
To recover the mind set.
You.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Wait, Will...
What's it narrow down to?
'Changes?'
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
You wanna watch this or what?!
What's that?
This is our boy...!
How far away's the back-up?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
In eight days.
It'll do fine.
Tonic will be fine.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I have work to do at the plant.
Me.
No.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Oh, God.
God, no.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
He only bit women so far, right?
What's average?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I call him a monster.
And you said?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
I have to see somebody.
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Will?  You could come up here.
Go on to the house...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
We don't know that.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
I got it. Thank you.
Stuart is fine.
I thought you would have some ideas.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Yes.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That's interesting.
I want your opinion.
Fight what?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Yes.
I hope you have a second chance...
I refuse.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
If you want...
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Are you sure?
Oh.
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
Where?
They're gonna lynch him!
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Hurry!
And you are?
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
It's Choi.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Hear what?
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
... Yeah.
Really?
I need an exit!  Fast!
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
He's beginning to believe.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
... Yes.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
No.
What truth?
What -- what lesson?
Yeah.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
But what?
How do you know that name?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
Why?
... shit.
What?
That's different.
No.
I don't know.  It just went dead.
I believe I can bring him back.
Yeah?
Do what?
It wasn't fast enough.
Not yet.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What are you talking about?
Because I believe in something.
Tank, it's me.
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Follow me.
Sounds good.
That means it's good.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok.  Wait here.
Be careful.
Kennedy.
Thanks for the ride.
Not quite...but keep trying.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Did you see them run!
How?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
I understand.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
That bad, huh?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
$20.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
Yeah, where's the rest?
Fine.
I know.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Oh...around...why?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Teresa.
All right.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Well...
It's all right.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
What is it now?
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
I know...I know.
Well...no.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Love that name.
He's cute.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
He said he would be there with bells on.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Both.
Hi.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Thank you.
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
What'd it say?
Did you just hear something?
Sounds good.
What do you mean?
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
How nice for you both.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
For how long?  And why?
Yours.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Well, that's very interesting.
Yeah.  Neat.
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
I from dat nex' place.
Make it go 'way.
Mine, too.
She knows you real self?
Didn't the family get together last night --?
And you're a nice man, Quince.
You love Allison, don't you?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
I'm sorry.
I haven't.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
It comforts you, doesn't it?
To bed.
Yes.  I'm tired.
I said get out.
I am.
How beautiful.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
I loved it.
And you can't tell me who you are.
Then don't.
We know all that we need to know --
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
I won't.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Good morning, Bill.
Yes?
Make an exception?
I don't understand.
Are you sad, Bill?
Of course.
It's all yours.
Absolutely.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I don't know.
Then I can't help you.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Well, they're mine now.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An indictable offense.
Death!
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
I'm sorry, I --
It's enough now.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Time.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Thank you, Quince.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
I am.  With you.
Bravo.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Will it?...
Oh, yes --
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
I agree --
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
From what?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
I have no memory.
What's it like?
What?
This isn't my room?
Just two. So far.							  *
Yeah?
A cop?
Don't say anything else.
Quiet!
Strip!
Deals?
Don't remember.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Yes.
Kill him.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
What happened?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
Yeah?
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
What do you want?
What are you here for?
Well, that's me.
Probably left it in your room.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Are you sure?
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
You can't just take it!
Why would I have a gun?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Yes you do...
Two main players plus three.
It goes very fast.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
That's right.
Exactly.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Really?
I know.  And now?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Then you should.
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
We don't know.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
How will it stand up?
Yeah.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
What would you do...?
Define small.
You set this up!
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
I ain't sleepy.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
For what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Whatsa matter now?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
You like it? Take a look.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Can he smell the difference, eh?
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
Gin's okay.
Instant V-goddam-D.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
I know.
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Beats working.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
What did he do?
A hundred grams.
That doesn't seem so bad.
How long?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Cut his fucking throat.
You know where it is?
Max - where?
What?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Shit.
Weird shit...?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
You got a better way up?
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
Across both tracks!!
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
I was just late.
Susan, we're not b-
That's camouflage...
How?!
Jump in.
Your arm, you can't...
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
She used a baster.
No shit.
How long...?
Following me?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
I guess that means it's okay.
Perfect.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Show me the way?
Yes.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
C'mere, I'll show you.
No, just the paper will be fine.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
You really think so?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm glad you like it.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
I'm almost done.
Just from his agent.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Maybe you can, Libby.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Not possible..
Sean, please..
Well that depends.
How do you that.
Ahh..
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
To do what?
And you're happy about that?
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
Ninety-three point four million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Exactly where is she?
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
I am. She is.
Uh-huh?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for everything.
Damn, you're beautiful.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Can you think of a better one?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Twice.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
I'm fine..
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Nyah still on the property?
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Do I?
By asking me.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Good idea.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Always.
May take a little time.
Talking's good, walking's better.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Who is "they?"
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
Sure...
Bastard!
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Is this the only way?
This stuff is so sticky.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I follow you.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
About what?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Why?
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
- and picked us up in the States -
I remember..
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Keep counting Claire.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Of course I can hear you.
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
Why you drinking so much?
I'm going to bed now.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Again?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You have too many dogs.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Just Johnny.
Because I have no Luck!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You ruined my life.
I can't!
I'll come to the wedding.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Hi.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Awful?
I wanna go home.
You're late!
Hi.
No?
This is a good suit.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Seven-thirty.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
A month from today?
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
I must ask for that back.
Where's the ring?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Where's pop?
It was a miracle.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
You gotta date?
You should think about this.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Johnny...
Sure!
It's nothing!
What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Yes.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Does wood sink in water?
Yes!
Through ... We found them.
The Britons.
Who are they?
NI!
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
So be it!
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
No.  No.  No!
Just keep me covered.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

Oh, just some friends!
I am an enchanter.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
There.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Well ... I AM king.
Yes, I see.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Why do you think she is a witch?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
Do me a favour.
Blue.
What is your name?
What is your quest?
I can't take him.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
But, Mother ...
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
We'll cover your escape!
I don't think I was.
No.  It's unhealthy.
Ector.
Please ... we are doctors.
You got my note!
He's come to rescue me, father.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Brave, Sir Rob ...
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
You know what I mean.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Louder, girl!
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I see.
She's busy.
It's so infernally cold in here.
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
We --
Back and upper corridors.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
I beg your pardon?
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
There are important papers from --
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
I don't think about it.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I do what I do.
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
She trusts you, John.
See what?
No love.
Ma'am.
I'm glad of it.
Yes, ma'am.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
To know when he'll be king.
No, she wasn't.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Yes.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Why?
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
Your Majesty --
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
He?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
We are talking...
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
She thought Benz was at school.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
What?!
My house.  I want to try something.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
I don't know.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
You didn't hear me?
One.  In case...
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Screamer.
Never been on a snowboard.
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
You have no time.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
Who fired everyone?
No.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Cynthia...what's going on?
You gotta be kidding?
There is no problem.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Well, I ...
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
You got it! See you later honey.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Right. See ya.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
What?
But it said #12.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
Oh...
But, this could be serious.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Mulholland Drive?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
I'm not sure about this.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Oh boy.
Interesting.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
Why should I ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
Okay.
Yes.
Girder, watch your head.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
That's a shame.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I don't help criminals.
Because of my charming personality ?
Knock yourself out.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't have to tell me twice.
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Son, let's watch the tape.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I was.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
You're paying the bills.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
I'm fine.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Where are we ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Of course.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
Thanks, I needed that.
Hi Dad.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
No.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Does she?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?

I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Hi.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Give it back Nicholas!
I won't.
You're so clever.
TAXI!!!
What difference does it make?
Oh my gosh, here it is!
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You would.
May I use the phone please.
This isn't just a mood ring.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Owh...
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
This has been a real confusing day.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
You know how I feel about you.
Is that a yes?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
She'll be all right baby.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I bet your mom sang to you.
You're telling me.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
What do you mean?
He is?
Good for you baby.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
No.
What Hurts Vada?
Deceased.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Okay.
It's nice.
Want to what?
Okay.
I'll second that.
Is it really your camper?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Why?
Can I go too?
Sorry.
Yes.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
He was allergic to bees.
There were just too many of 'em.
What??
No, no.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Are you sure about all this?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
He likes her.
Yes it is.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Uh huh.
No, I'm divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
No.
Yes!!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
No.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
What?
What?
So?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
But I have my clothes on!
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Then go home, baby.
Not true.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Would you think of me?
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
The wandering sportswriter.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Impressive.
I wish.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
No.
I was gonna predict that.
Gold nose hair clippers.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
I just don't want to freak him out.
... look good on Kimberly.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Mirrors.
She finds him "personable."
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You keep saying that.
If you like.
The night we met.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
And your point?
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
... yeah, that.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
... and you knew about this.
What is that sup...
What do you have to buy?
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Is there food?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I see.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Oh, sure.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Whose word?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
You know better than that.
ABC.
D.C.
Okay.
Stop it!
When is it?
How come?
To the bathroom.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
She's in Paris.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
She sure sings nice.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Well, he's really amazing.
No.
No.
Do you carry door handles?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
It just is.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I'm not sure.
Oh.
Oh.
What?
What...?  0h, yes.
Yea.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Out.
How long have you been together?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Where is she?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
No, we never did that
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Where are you from?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Yes you are.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Are we in a big hurry?
Susanville, Soledade.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
I see.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Says who?
Okay, let's cut it.
Sure.
Yeah, we have a van.
Out front.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
I do, too.
Yes.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Where do the air ducts lead?
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Next week's episode.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Perfecto!
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Really?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
What are we talking about?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
You in a big hurry, boy?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Okay.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Yeah. On the section gang.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
No thanks.
That's right.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
You got a problem all right.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Why did you?
What?
Okay, I guess.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Well, what d'you think?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
Yeah, that's so.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I don't want to hurt you.
Huh?
We can always do that, Duff.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
'Round town.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Plannin' on getting married?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Who is?!
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
Thank you.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
It ain't in me.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Omar, listen to me--
Of course...
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
What are you talking about?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Can you take me to it?
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
We run. You crack the pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
It's coming.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
No!... No...
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Why should I want to meet him.
What's my end?
Almost two days.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Too late?
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Case...
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
I know you have. C'mere.
What is it?
You're out of time, man.
Hold on.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Well, do you?
Nice.
Oh I know.
Petty good.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Yeah.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Anita!
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Five-- Six--
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
He's my teacher!
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
I'm Rob's prom date.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Is that true?
No. Josie, this is real.
Really?
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You remember that story?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
I finally found my story.
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Who are you guys?
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Where?
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
No.
Can't you make other creations?
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
It's not the gas, Dad!
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Where's Jesse?
What the hell are you talking about?
Only the wet ones.
Shut up, Grady.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Wow...
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
About what?
Why won't you talk to me?
I killed him!  I killed him!
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Okay, I guess.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Hi, Kerry.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
First door up the stairs.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
He's full of shit.
Mom?
I thought I'd wait for you.
Watching TV.
Deal.  Thanks.
No, she's right.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
He's heavy in the halls...
I don't know.
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
Anything?
Your dreams?
What about Kristen?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
A sad choice.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I won't allow it.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Really?
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Okay.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
That's fine.
Let's go in.
You abide by rules like that?
What did you say?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Step aside.
She left me.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
What?
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Who was Gilda?
You do?
What's your name?
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Yes -- sort of...
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Shame!
Well, thanks, that's great.
What's your name?
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
The others?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
No, it doesn't.
No -- did you?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I believe I have.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
So -- any messages?
No, 'fraid not.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Yes.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
What book?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Y-y-y-yes...
I was in luh-love with her.
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
I wanna report a robbery!
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Go on...
No way.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
H-H-Hearts.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Are they all crazies?
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Yeah, Mack?
Where ya goin', Mac?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Huh?
Through the ass.
What?
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Now, what would I be trying to say?
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
No!
Sure, Mack...
No!
No!
Just wait till you hear...
Gary Blinker...
Hit me.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
A nickel.
Yeah, it's cold!
No.
What is it?
Hold it!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Time out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay!
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
What's going on?
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
I don't believe it...
Shhh!  This way!
You's better believe it, brother!
Okay. How you doing?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Oh, yeah...
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Evenin', ma'am.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
You ol' fucker!
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Buona notte.
No.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
You're sure...
Yes.  We did.
Hi there...
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
What?
Who says I don't love him?...
Because.  I know where he is.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
What?
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Just since yesterday.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
No.  He smokes.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, what's your point?
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
So?...
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
No...  I can just tell.
But it's July.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
I meant about my idea.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Hi.  Where've you been?
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
...and a fortune teller.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Yup.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Kate.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
I'd love to.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
I know. I know.
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Why Edie, I—
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Terry... Terry... .
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Good. So do I.
Oh she's a beauty.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
What for?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
What I did to Joey.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Who is he, Pop?
I'll find you a priest.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
A question of who rides who.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to—
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Such as what?
Raise a hand to me and... .
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Looking for me?
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Take it easy now, Terry.
So-so, Johnny.
Aw, Johnny... .
How'd you get that.
Go on, beat it!
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Maybe so.
Of course I do.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
It would seem so, Master
Ahh, there is yet time.
I will decide the conclusion.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
What?!
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Really.  Hm.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Why don't we talk about it later?
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Uh-huh...
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
And who watches your back?
They sure do.
Shit.
All you gotta do is get in.
You have to know what you're talking about.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Excuse me, Adele?
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
I don't smoke.
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I could have a little more room.
I thought so, too.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Sure.
Peter Finch.
Nothing.
You'd probably tell me.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Really.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Yes.
You won't do that.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I can go to the bar.
I don't have a problem with it.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
It would be worth the risk.
You believe that?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
To warn her about Chino.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
In the trunk?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
I'm freezing my ass off.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Oh...
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
You not with probation, one of those?
He said he stayed here last November.
What're you doing at Glades?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
No?
Hello?
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
It's possible.  Why?
Likewise.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Are they dead?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Yes Sir.
Where's that lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
What facts are those?
I was grieving too.
Come on!
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Home of the brave.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
I can't make it.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Our doctor's gone too.
Yes'm.
Respect.
You too, Lieutenant.
We're all going away.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
How did you?...
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Peggy Sue!
I can't. It's all too much.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Charlie...
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Pretty strange.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Refresh my memory.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Thanks.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Who?
Save it.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Of course.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Of course.
Test?
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
But I'm remembering the future.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
It must run in the family.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Is that one of your poems?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
What?
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh. I forgot.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
What does Charlie think about that?
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
I'm just happy to see you.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
You have an incredible memory.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
It really wasn't that difficult.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I	know what a burrito is.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I don't know.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Well... uh... thanks...
How'd you know that?
Yes... why?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm not hungry.
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Yeah...
You think he'd believe it if he did?
Go later...
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
Bob...
Because they deserve to, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Andy?
I am relaxed.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
Close the law book.
Of course.
Funny.
Little baby girl.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
What?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Let's find you a drink.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Do you... pray?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
I still am.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
You bet. We'll see you later.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Gay movies.
Yes.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Answer the question, please.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Get real.
Uh.... No. Not really.
We were satisfied.
I might.
In a word, yes.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Not especially.
Probably since she was born.
Okay, Joe...
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
You had one guy "like that?"
Dr. J.!
Andy, you don't want this.
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Show me your eyes.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Saw something I didn't like.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<u>Listen</u>.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
It's starting....
Like the light is scalding it.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Probably right.
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
What?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
I assume he licked it clean.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
60 years ago.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Company's not here, is it?
We're all on the same hajj now.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Riddick?
There is no "safe."
Which half?
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Say that again.
Said "looks clear."
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
What's so special about him?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
It's probably wrong --
But how long is a day?
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Don't bother
I'm for that.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
What is it?
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Read it yourself.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Which one?
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
Maybe not.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Yes, Sir.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Where's Elias come from?
Over here!
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
No!
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
What are the heads?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
You know what I'm talking about!
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
These two holes are yours...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm supposing.
I haven't been invited.
Would you mind?
How do you do?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
Just drunk enough.
How long would that take?
Do you think I don't?
That's all there is.
Just who are you, anyway?
Is this the best you can do?
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Absolutely sure.
So have I.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
They'll look for you.
Killaine...
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
That's right.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
I've never been to Florida.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
Is it a crime?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
We know everything.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
A thousand.
Leave that one lay.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
What?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Would you?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
You get it's brother.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Do I know who lives down there?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Not if it clears the air.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
She might.
I'll take your word.
How do you do, sir.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Nice.
You ought to know why.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
Years, why?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
It's fine, thank you.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
I will, thanks.
Yes.
I see.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Very thoughtful.
You just might.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
To the airlift.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
It's shit.
Ha ha...
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Will it be fun?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Yes, finally.
I'm not here.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
No, thanks Dad.
No.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
She said that?
Voila!
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
No.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
My man!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You do it... you first!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Yes, sir.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
What that?
The shit they pull, huh?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Thanks, buddy.
Right here, partner.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I need you to teach me.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
What do you mean?
Like the old days, Dillon.
Who's our back-up on this?
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Right behind you.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Hawkins?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
No.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
You what?
What's that?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Edward.  My name is Edward.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
You're forgiven.
I have work to do.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Dinner can wait.
No.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
I think it's exciting.
Vivian...
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I more than liked it.
You just did.
What do you mean?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
No.
Yes...
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Yes.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Go for the bucks.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Will I like it?
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Steak spoon! 
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I just might do that.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then I'm here till I die?
Then why bother curing me?
So it's to be torture.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Of course.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
It never happened.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Who's Guilder?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
Yes, some of the time. 
How many could you handle?
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
-- where?
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Over the Albino, I think.
What?
I don't be-leeve this.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Someday, you may not mind so much.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Okay.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
DEATH FIRST!!
No.  To the pain.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
I thought he was with you.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Hah?
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Nothing comes to mind.
Inconceivable!
You know what a hurry we're in.
Good. Then pour the wine.
I'm not listening.
A little bit.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Congratulations.
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Honeymoon,
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Where?  What?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
No way out.  No way out.
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Really, I never dreamed ...
Yes.  We would!
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
No.  We go. 
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
What do you do best?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
We won.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
How much?
Of course not. Please.
Five hundred.
All right.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Lila.
With you.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
No.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
You've led a charmed life.
Maybe we can handle it together. 
Who's he?
Does that mean we can't...
She always tries to be proper.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Hospital clean.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
Can you?
I have to go, Sam.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I'm sorry.
At this hour?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I don't know what you've been saying.
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
I'm losing my blood!
That called ... commanded ...
Yes!
Yes, the child ...
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Horsefeathers!
Cry-baby?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Who'd steal her body?
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Good night, sir.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
Dad...
I'm heading out of town.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Okay.
Five hundred rabbits?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
All right, what do you know?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
She's getting herself up to go out.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Boy! Wow!
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
No, son, she is dead.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Over... my... dead... body!
Who?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Oh, yeah?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
You can stop it right now.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
More history, Rose.
Yes, Ma'am.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Be quiet, Rose.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
What and?  That's what I got.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
I'm just saying...
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
Entertainers don't count.
They shot us all, kid.
Same day as before.  I think.
Feeling great.
You don't smoke.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
You know... you could say thank you.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Absolutely.
No you're not.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Whatever goes bang.
Gimmie a minute.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
It's one of a kind.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
I can't kill my own father.
Yoda spoke of another.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
His lightsaber.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Leia!
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Lando!
Lower it!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
You, too.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Oh. Well, yes.
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet.
Janet.
Dammit, Janet.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
We must have a blow-out.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
You know this earth - this person.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
I didn't make him for you
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
That ain't no crime
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Creature of the night.
...I'm sorry.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
I think it's closed.
Ohh!
...No thanks.
Do you have a phone?
Don't tease me.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Don't want weak legs.
-- The legs.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...What?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
...What?
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
It's not your house --
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Get that doctor.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Very high an' very fast.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Of wa?
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
No dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
I agree.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Yeah.
Do I have to pay juice?
No -- Just me.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Spider Rice.
Yeah.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Damn! How's it look?
...The guy's great.
Fine... That guy's great.
See what?
Great, kid, great.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Looks, huh?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Absolutely...
Maybe ya better forget it.
Ice skate.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Whatta you think?
Sure I like her.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
What can I do about it?
...People talk to me more.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Check the scrawl.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
So what do you want me to do?
I don't work in Toontown.
Divorce?  Never!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Get away from there.
I rest my case.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Romeo will answer it?
Good-morrow, cousin.
But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
At thy good heart's oppression.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
But 'tis no wit to go.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
She'll not come down tonight.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Well what shall I swear by?
If my heart's dear love--
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
What?
Of course.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
And I don't believe you...
Which leads us to...
That's why you were riding with him.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
I thought I did.
You lose them!
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Ready when you are...
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
You first, Edvard.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
But you hate each other!
A post office box.
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
There is one other thing...
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
My way is better.
Did he bring that with him?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't think so.
Coordinate what?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Like Larry or Swede.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wanted to see who you were.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
But you can't.
Not exactly.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
You don't have to do this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Yes.
Very ugly.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
Right now?
Business keeps you on the road?
Do you have a good answer?
I'll work on it...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
You sure?
Seamus Reilly.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
The Russian would be easier.
Dwayne listen to me -
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Hell, it won't be us!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Maybe.  Who cares?
I don't know.
What's that?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
What's your offer, Jesse?
None of us like it!
Shut up, Jesse.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
No.  Why?
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I love you too.
Great...
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
I love you Sally.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
You know I do.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
We appreciate that.
Dwayne.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Sure.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
So be here at three.
Well I'm here now.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I didn't say that.  You did.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Dwayne -
Then what the hell are you all about?
Well you're not getting, either.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Give me the bad news.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
I'd like to see you try.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
And you ain't black!
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Excuse me?
It's a bomb.
Shhh, my head hurts.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Amen to that, brother.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Now you know.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Are you okay, Lee?
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Carter.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
I was being polite.
It was not my intent --
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stool pigeon.
Yes, I know this song.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
I am from outa town.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Where'd you get it?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
No...what?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Shut up!
What are you talking about?
She's fine.
Han?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
His hair... any color.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
What?
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Where do you think she's going?
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
You're coming here?
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Yes.
A pre-wedding luau?
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Seven-fifty.
You afraid to try?
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
No.  You take it.
Missed me bad, huh?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Where?
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Thank you, Dad.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No, you tell her.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Does it have wheat in it?
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
It was my mother's.
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
Not.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
"I want to meet you..."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
I always wondered about that too.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Good night.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Come on, Jonah --
What?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Destiny takes a hand.
Magic.
Like... clockwork.
Magic.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
It's not that late in Seattle.
I don't know --
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
Yeah.  What's that?
Window.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
What do you think?
What?
What was?
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
It might be in the kitchen.
Are you going with her?
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
Okay.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Well...
Hi.  Sam?
You did?
He's good at it.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
No thanks.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
There's nothing stopping you.
How's it going?
You want 'em all arrested?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
It never ends.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
What?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
I'm a fool.
Over my dead body.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Be still ...
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Will you be still?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
What attitude?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Yeah.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
How about in the house?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I'll see you tonight.
Ouch.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Colette ...
Nothing.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
What happened to your eye?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Like you?
I try.
You really need to lighten up.
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
It's me.
Why?
Danny, it's not what you think.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Can you set that up?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy
Wait till I tell you what it is.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Yeah.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
This chink have a name?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Answer the fucking question!
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Yeah.  What about him?
To who?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
That would be me.
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Again, I thank you.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Don't worry about it.
...alright, let me know when.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Figured.
No kidding.
You must be a hell a shot.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Cap'n...?
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Senator's son?
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
Plenty.
Goddamn it, sir...
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
That's not what we're here for.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Is it getting worse?
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Let's just find someplace.
Bits and pieces.
Yes, sir.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
But we accomplish the mission.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Alright, come with me.
Yeah?
And Sarge?
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Lingerie.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Hey, sis.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
What's a scam?
Read it.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I dream about it.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Okay.
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
But I found the money.
What am I supposed to think?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
Job?  Being a great date.
You think so?
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Friends with potential.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
Oh.  I was putting the...
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No, we don't have to say it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
We decided...
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Oh shit.
I'm sorry.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
I'm totally and completely serious.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Hey.
You know Diane Court?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you too.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
In Breslau.
You're kidding.
They're not gone, they're here.
He's important to my business.
These people, my people, I want my people.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
Nice things cost money.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
I need a drink.
Pistols?
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Yes.
Yes.
Oskar -
Are you losing money?
And killing.
Stern.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
That doesn't work, sir.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
On national television.
Where?
What? I can't hear you...
Who is this?
Where is everybody?
Why would you wanna do that?
I'm inquisitive.
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Did it?
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Tons and tons.
Home--where he lives.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
What's your subject?
Not one bit.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Tails.
Tuition’s expensive.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Meaning?
Can we turn the light on?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Over here.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
Dewey, there's no such place.
What if your life depended on it?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Where is your attacker?
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Yeah, right.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Easy black boy.
Thanks, Joel.
Closer than you think.
We got free tickets.
Where you going?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Melinda McGraw?
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
The killer called her.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Fuck!
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
But you know who she was.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I am Gale Weathers!
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What are you talking about?
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
No one's saying you did.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
You know it.
Oh yeah.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
You sleep in THAT?
Oh it did?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Oh Sidney...
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You're making popcorn?
What's your favorite scary movie?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
What do you think I said?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Turn off the light.
Come on, yes you do.
I can't think.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Answer the question and I will.
Your call.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Mind if I join you?
What kind of lead?
Yes, you doofus.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Yeah.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
You think he could still be in town?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
I owe you shit.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Has his story changed?
And why would she do that?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Can you knock?
Got it.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
The why'd the police let him go?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Like you had one.
Wanna another beer?
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
They think it's school-related?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
So you think my mom was a slut too?
And you believe it?
Come on, let's rock.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Tits -- see.
Give it to me.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
So what?  This victim...
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Her pretty head.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
You know that's not true.
Spit it out.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers?
Murderers like you?
And, why is that?
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
No one yet.
Guessing at this point is useless.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
Hello.
I read.  Remember reading?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
And, if it's a threat.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Just wait!
No.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
And so what?
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
I'm fine.
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
That part of me is dead.
Don't do this... please...
I can't do this now... please.
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
I hate this city.
I want to have children.  It's just...
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
I ain't wearing no gun.
No sir...pleasure.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Now mount up, son...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Because she's my...my...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Cut it out, will ya...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
We won't be here...Come on!
It's what I'm countin' on.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Finish your breakfast...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
You?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Someone from the village.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
In the village.  Look what I found.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Hi, darling.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Does this dog here belong to you?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
And the title of this piece?
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Writer, is he?
Twenty pounds on delivery
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
No Juliet?!
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Yes, I saw it.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
She is always Aphrodite.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
Go on.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Do you think?
Mercutio…good name.
"Is the day so young?"
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Verona again.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I like her.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
Who is there?
Oh, not for the world!
There is.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
A literary feud. Quite normal.
You cannot marry Wessex!
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
How does it?
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Virginia?!
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Do you understand me?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
Does she say so?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
A theatre poet?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Just serve.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Can we talk about something?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
We just wanted to speak to you.
I beg your pardon?
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
So I gathered.
Not at all.
Where do you think you'll go?
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know.
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Well, then?
Yes.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Well, yes.
Really?
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is a hack.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
His car's still there.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
I'm just looking.
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Who was it?
He can't stay up there.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I'll wait there.
Alex.
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
What?
Of course.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
Do you smoke?
No.
Yes. They're my friends.
What?
Right here?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
You must be Juliet.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
It's a breeze.
No.
It's an improvement.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
What?
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
It turned out to be cancer.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I gotta talk to you.
Calm down, baby.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Well she...
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hungry?
... yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
You think that's funny, don't you?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Right.
She is.
Great.
They are?
Buffums?
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Okay.
It's hot in here.
Do you? You still see him?
Did Lester know about him?
I just have to do one little thing.
What are you talking about?
-- we can't now.
I am you, you little bastard.
-- we are?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
That's it, then I'm leaving.
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Wash her.
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
What's gonna happen?
What?
Who?
No shit?
I am?
Of course I like children.
Could I?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
About what?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
-- go ahead.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I'm very tired, George.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know, that's all.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
Well, yeah.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
You're right.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
-- yeah?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
Now wait a minute...
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What about her?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Yes I do.
What?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
I'll call you back.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Then you were talking to him.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
That's not very logical, Lester.
Why not?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
You know what's wrong.
I know, I'm sorry.
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Jill.
-- just wonderful.
No.
Do you feel bad?
I guess so.
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to.
How does he tell you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Try to think what it was.
Okay.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.
No.
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny!
Oh!
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Well how can I repay you?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
And, er... where are they now?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Sure.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Pleased to meet you.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Thank you for saying so.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Your money's no good here.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Uh...huh.
Yes, I did.
Yes.
Jack...
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
I'm intrigued.
Well, my predecessor in this job
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Royalty?
Oh!
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
Eight thirty.
Uncle Al-
Blue. This blue.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Jane-
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
What?
Yeah... sure.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
You want to know what I think?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Were you tempted?
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
What?
Good evening, Vincent.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
What is it, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Just about.  Show me again.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Chops?
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
It's true -- I know her.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
You know that song?
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
I knew that.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Wet behind the ears.
Again!
What?
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
You re okay -- for a civilian.
What?  What time is it?
A novice.
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Keep moving!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
It's true!
What? 
Would you like that?
Can do.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
You have a phone call.
Maybe Hawaii.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
I've been worried about you.
How?
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
Take care of it.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
That's what I figured, too.
She's praying.
That should have tipped us.
It's brought people back to the church.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
A Benedictine.
Christy.
Yes?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
A diseased monster.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Well... that might be... helpful.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Chosen me?
Not for lack of trying.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Lady Van Tassel.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
If you want.  But...
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What?
Come with me.
What would you have me believe?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
He moves too fast.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Let her go!
I can show exactly.
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
That boy wants me to.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Good to know you, Karl.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
He does make some funny noises.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
It went real good.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
I hate you!
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Why? Hi, Karl.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Yeah.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
All right then.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I reckon.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
I've got a feelin' today.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Nice to meet you, Karl.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
Yes, I guess you are.
I want to come back and stay here.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
I reckon.
I never was no good with history.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
I didn't aim to.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
So, you're really going to stay here?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Signs?
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Better make it charge. 
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What's that, Sol?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
You got it.
Eighteen and a half years.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
What can I do for you?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I owe you something.
I mean breakfast.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
You work too hard, you know that?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
His only copy?
Here, catch.
And started to run.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
It seems human.  To me.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And the last...?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
I have told the truth.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Maybe...?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
I should show them an American?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
I don't think so.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
The same.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Not in those words.
I can't speak for him.
That's all he said.
Get lost, will you?
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
Shave our legs, stupid.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
And I'm Daphne.
Polish?
Down, Daphne!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Fight it.
Then pull the emergency brake!
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
He's going to be ashore with you.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
You think he's too old for me?
Security.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Like right after the ceremony.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Shut up and keep packing.
Get me Room 414.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
That's ridiculous.
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
When?
I'm just going to get some ice.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I met one of them.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Oh - here and there - and around.
You invest in shows?
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
I'll throw up!
Flower girl.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
We won't breathe a word.
Oh, no!
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Why?
My car?  Why, you -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
It's not the backs that worry me.
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Have you ever been with a male band?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
What's in Florida?
Would you mind terribly?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Who are you?
Not very likely.
Not at all.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
- Inauguration balls -
What theory?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
What?
I am?
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Completely.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
That makes me feel just awful.
What happened?
You poor, poor boy.
Is it that hopeless?
What is it?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
You and who else?
Yes, sir.
Spats Colombo.
Why wouldn't I?
What for?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
What? Why? What do you mean?
Are you sure you’re okay?
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Oh, don’t be that way.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven’t made up since.
What?
And you do now?
Shrink, actually.
What?
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
You have feet?
You’re funny.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
You’re too good for him.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Oh, no.
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Desperation?
Yeah.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Thank you.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
It’s complicated, Dad.
“...but it’s getting there. “
I haven’t thought about that in years.
Is there any other way to take it?
At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
Uh huh...
Sure--
What's his name?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
What do that mean?
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
NO! N-O, NO!
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Here, put my jacket over you.
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
What happened afta that?
Thank you, Daddy...
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Sunday...
I don't look like no possum!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
That's right!
Children, come here...
No mam -- I looked all over.
Good night...
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
It's the heat.
He can't get up, Mama!
I'll walk...
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Tired.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Is there something I can do to help you?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Montana.
Pillow.
I saw him last night!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
And she's getting worse...
YOU DO?!
Whoops.
No way.
No you can't Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
Eric?
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Uhh... I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
For pooping, silly.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Kyle, check it out.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
YOU BASTARD!!
Our moms suck!
I don't know, dude.
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Me?!
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
What the hell is going on?!
Oh.
No, it was worse than that...
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
I know, Terrance. I know.
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You don't care.
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Magnificent, magnificent.
It certainly is.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
I know, I know.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I don't know.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Why can't we?
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Helllp!
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
Why?  Where are you going?
I can't!
I'm about to blow the wall.
I'll do my best.
Over and out.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
I guess so.
How am I supposed to know?
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
What are you going to do about it?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
It's mine.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
What's it look like to you?
You got a better offer?
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I couldn't care less.
I am underground.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
Why would you help me?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Where can I find him?
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
The mental hospital.
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
Nothing.
Really? I kinda like it.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I could let them go for ten.
You're here.
...lane six. Yes.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why should I help that old fuck.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
I'm not here to bowl.
I'm looking for somebody.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
I said back away.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What if it attacks?
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
It's impossible.
What team?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
What the hell is going on here?
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
What?
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
How do you mean, strange?
What -- you want me to retype it?
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Sir, about leaving --
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Wait -- down where?
What -- are you threatening me?
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, why?
Beth.
Beth.
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You don't trust me?
Still clear.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
We must've had it delivered then.
You think?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Something for burns.
Tarazine?
How long does it last?
For what?
I'm feeling better.
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
It's not safe for you to be either.
I --
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Beth --
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
I never said that.
Like what?  I'm not --
What?
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm fine.
No, why don't --
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
How do we decode it?
Shut up and catch.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
But it's impossible.
Think about it.
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
No, they didn't say --
What report?
Huh?
You mean you don't know?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Like what?
Unless it's an act.
I don't know.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Not bad.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
You could put it that way.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Send one squad up.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
What about it, Diz ?
Not enough, I guess.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Your father will never let you.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Yeah.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Carl can wait.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Who cares ?
I'll go for that.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
How are you, Carl ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Thank you, ma'am.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Flip six, three hole.
You got it.
I'm on it !
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Courage, I guess.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Hi, mom.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Move out.
Been better, buddy.
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Yes, sir !
You may proceede.
The Creator has not answered.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
That is how V'ger will survive.
By the Creator.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Mr Decker....
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Thrusters ahead, one third.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Our... 'insignificance'?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Precisely.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
To you, sir?
Dock signals clear, Captain.
I'll be there.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It's in your play.
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
And likewise.
Everyday things...yes.
Surest thing you know.
You'd know better'n me.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Oh, God...
The other side.
Gosh, you look nice.
Oh yeah.
Now you're talking...
Carla was in the car, right?
Water or mineral deposits.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Yes, that's right.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
We'll work it out...
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
...they run on water.
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I loved it...he...
I don't eat vegetables.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
We've got three days to...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hob...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
There's other things to be learned.
I think he's moved...
Then what is the...?
Why?
Who is that...?
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yes, yes, but...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
We, we have to give it.
...she has a <u>home</u>...
He treated me as if I were a child...
Marty...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
I can't tell.
Who got their heads cut?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
Doug, this is Mr...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Gut Yuntif.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
A witness to what...?
Sure.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
I can't find the writer.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
I don't drink.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
The girl was in the car.
For what cause?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
I didn't say anything to them.
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
They're coming Fedex...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
Is that one hell of a kid?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
...not the Lazyboy...
...it is?
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I don't care.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Or blush.  You look pale.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Yes.
MOMMY!
Honey, she won't d...
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
You owe me a quarter.
Then have a donut --
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Is that like Luigi's?
Mom...?
You have the WORST flu since...
That's Rache's song!
I helped.
Rache can do that part.
You dying.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Easy enough.
Don't do this.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
I live or I die.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
...it's my problem, too.
Ironic, huh?
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Don't be too sure.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Oh please.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
You're the hip and fresh.
You'll learn.
I have their past.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
We have to talk.
So I'll have to order in?
For what?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
I think so...What do you think?
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Well, they will be.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Does Jackie know this?
Hey. What's up?
What?
Like what?
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
Jesus was not bad.
I am sure.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
You know he hated my story also.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Just the same.
Tired of this shit...
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
...gger.
Again!
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Toby Oxman.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
We don't have time!
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
I guess not Cooper...
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
Are you going to kill us?
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
I don't want any...
What do you mean?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
I say we head out.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Yes, of course.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
What did you say?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
What kind of trouble?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
To peace on earth.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Speed?
They're moving apart.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Master Kong.
Everything still checks out okay.
What are you talking about?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Roger.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
I don't anymore.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah.
Was it okay?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
The dude wants it.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
No, I'm not worried.
Uh, last night...
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
She's dead.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Guess not.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Are you talking to me?
Glad it's okay.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Hey, thanks, man.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Yeah.
Okay.
He is?
Really?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Thank you.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
That, that's Indian?
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Hey!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Yeah.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Mm-hm.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Yes, you do.
You do.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
'Bye, Jeff.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Like songs?
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Hey.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
You done?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Don't swear it's impolite.
Sorry, Kansas...
Cleo!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
You sure?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Spit from your dad?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Trix...
That was gas, Sweetie.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
We're here for you, Diane.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Bullets.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Definitely old.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I'll take it.
What's wrong with it?
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
What teacher?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
So long.
Well, for heaven's sake!
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Nobody can be that busy.
You're tough, all right.
Nice job.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Twenty-two.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
No.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It is not.  Get out.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
You can stay here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Just follow me.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
You're a darling.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
I think I'll read a little.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Dressed for what?
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
She is upstairs.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
No?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Yes.  Madame.
Who?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You love me?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Why not ?
Terrific.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
But I don't understand.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Yes.
She has hostages.
What an adorable hat.
You vicious--
Well...I guess I can't.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Nice to meet you.
Can I quote you?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
But what for?
You sure?
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I know.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
I knew it!
Then come with me.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
I seem to be.
Clark.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
It sure is.
Oh...I came close once.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Call me.
Uh-huh.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Kent!
Mom and I do this all the time.
We get together sometimes.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
At one o'clock in the morning?
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Yeah. A raise . .
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
First question got to be "Where."
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
God, that's what I keep you for.
Fair's fair.
You designed it?
What will it get me?
I didn't have my camera with me.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
We've already met.
You just did, with that great dinner.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Where's the handle?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
What's wrong?
A normal person.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
Be my guest.
In July???
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Let's get you inside . . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Never closed my eyes.
Everything on it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Wrong.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Yes.
Now This I want to hear.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
What shall we do now?
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Sentimental idiot.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Clark. . . !
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Absolutely!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
. . . And  very naïve!
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
A toupee that flies?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
One of them should've been you.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Unbelievable.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
I didn't say a word.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
How good it felt!
Twenty-four.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Right on the first guess.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
It's not bad.
What about it?
Pink.
Very much.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
How are you?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Which one?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Was it good?
Why?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Billy, that's too early.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
You believe that?
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berries.
Berry-picking.
Yes.  He does.
I did.
Why would he be frightened?
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
No.  A little sugar though.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
I feel like a princess.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
What's a ditty again?
Oh.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Will you be spending more than a night?
People who will help our cause.
What do they do?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Perfect.
So what's the problem?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
You can't come here.
And where did you sit that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Before the actual accident?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
It's okay.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
I don't know.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
But Charlene...
You don't know that.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
I'll listen one more minute.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Hello.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
What kind of an act is this?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
But what?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Take a top coat.
Nothing...
Why not you?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
What chip?
Let me try mine.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Max.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You told me to.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
What?
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Chill out, dickwad.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No problemo.
She intends to change the future somehow.
What?
I have to go away, John.
No!  Don't kill him!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Go!  I'll finish here.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Unknown.
Why attack Russia?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I don't know.
But I promised your mother.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
and totally irrelevant.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Colonel. Pleasure.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Yes.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
That is correct.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
I don't buy that.
May I ask a question?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
And what did he say?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
This is absolute nonsense!
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Of course I know what that is.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Show you?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Yeah?
He did?
Who's he?
His private life?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Sure.
Like this bandleader.
Absolutely not.
Come to the office, please.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
You know your weapons, buddy.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I thought you did.
The what?
What?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
About where you're from.
What's that?
Molecular-memory.
That's not my mission.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want it to be over for you.
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
I don't think he's breathing.
Don't just stand there, get help!
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
What are you talking about?
You should be.
Never mind.
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I think not.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Come here...
Is this you?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
What's wrong?
Get out.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Fuck you.
I saw them kill him!
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Underwear?
Why?
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Really?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Robbed?
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
It was a different floor then...
The key?
Is there a room key?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  Where was she?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
His behavior... ?
Look, where is he?!
No.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Don't ask.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You know you can.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Well, I... uh...
Go ahead.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Just stay there, Nell!
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Luke.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
And that will be a good place to end this study.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
It was.
Test it.
That?  That's Hill House.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
How could you do this to people?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
Why'd she kill herself?
No one will come any nearer than that.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Maybe you did it yourself.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I think so.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Then what good is he?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
What kind of food?
Sure.
We all did.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
There's been some trouble downtown.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Eduardo.  Rama.
Huh?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
And that's where you met Jenny.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
You goin' back inside?
He's gotta know why.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Probably.
You just cooking then?
No, but I know what he means.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
She never told Eddie, though.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
That's what was estimated.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Get seven years, did you?
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Ian?
No kidding.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Yeah.
The forever kind.
I don't know.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Lemme break.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
What do you think?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
No trouble.
You know I don't live with him.
Be seein' you.
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes. Thank you.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Oh, Mr Crane--
...Uh-huh.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
I don't understand.
And how do we share--
Ed.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
Told what?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
How's that?
Mm.
Congratulations, Gina.
...I don't think so.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Sure you don't need one?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
So, who should I--
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Yeah.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Uh-huh.
What the--
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
Huh? No.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
He's the dead guy.
What'd he say?
Could you come with me please?
Uh... you're under arrest.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
I don't want to scare people.
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
What doors?
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Whose footprints?
Call me Vince.
So the method of death is the only connection?
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What is it?
I know.
Oh shit.
I'd say we're in its home.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Look who's here, Margo.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Yes.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Holy mother, what is that?
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
So what?
And John?
You loved him.
You were going to be married.
A monster?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
Would you mind showing it to me?
Where did you see it?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Today.
Why wouldn't I?
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
You're the star.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I think I've studied enough.
Nursery?
Yeah, what happened?
You think so?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
Gee, that's great.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I still want to look over a couple of things.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
Put some butter on it--or ice?
I won't be here Sunday.
What?!
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Do something...
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
--How do you know about that?
We don't even know you.
Nothing completely conclusive --
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Looking for him for what?
What's that?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
How?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What did it look like?
Nice try, Mulder.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
No.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Very weird.
Where are we?
I don't have his number.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Where's Scully?!
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
A pocketful of rye...
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
What's wrong?
As far as I needed.
I realize that...
Peter, okay?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Then what is he?
Little boy?!  That's him!
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
I need you to find something in the basement...
That hoist, with the winch...
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
What's wrong?
Yes.
Completely unaware.
What else do we do?!
They think you did it.
Sit down.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Dr. Winkel.
Where is she?
We're both in it, Harry.
Me.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
There isn't enough for two laughs.
How did you know I would be here?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Oh, the usual things...
Yes.
They're Harry's.
There's nothing in them.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
I have never seen him.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't...
Just around the corner.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
No, not yet.
Martins.
Yes.
No.
When did you see him last?
No.
Best thing that ever happened...
It wasn't petrol.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Bring him in.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
Thank you. Excuse me.
No.
Of course.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
This way, miss.
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
What is it, Sergeant?
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
You can help her.
I told the police.
And - Anna...
What did he say?
I have guests waiting.
English?
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lime - yes.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What's he saying?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Oh.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Okay.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
One or two kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
What!
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Eh - bonsoir.
No.
Richard, you know something -
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
They don't have extermination camps.
They sound like you.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Fire...
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Then how come you're talking to me?
He's at a home out here.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Oh, yeah... 
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Do they?
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Lina, come here!
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You gotta get out of here.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I agree.
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Female...
He has Israel.
So you're saying it's not true.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
No.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Get the fuck away from me.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
How did you...?
Fucking kike.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Yes!
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
So what Jew would you kill first?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Steve...
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
I've got to get back to the --
Who told you that?
The mother.
What...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Shut up...
Why me?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
No.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
The documents are forged.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Hello!
In a lake.
Italy!
Okay.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
That idiot!
Lira?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Then tell him to wax it too.
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Fine!
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
... I'm listening.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
... Yes.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
... I was right about what?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... The way she moves.
I did?
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
It's me... Johana.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
It's me again.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Anything.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
He doesn't hear too well.
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
It's my apartment.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
You called the police?
Haven't you been listening?
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
No.  I'm just depressed.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Then, goodbye.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
What's up?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Yeah, no kidding.
I said, do you come here often!?
We go to the same temple.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
He's still working out some identity issues.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Worse.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Resting?
That depends. How much money has he?
I don't know —-
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I sleep it off.
You found the leopard!
Who?
What are you doing that for?
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Tomorrow -—
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Good evening.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
We're old friends.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was a calamity!
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought they came right past here ——
Go on foot.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Now look what you've done.
Don't be soft.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
You. Us.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
You a tourist?
Will you please come with me?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Disney! How inter...
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Something like that.
Should I?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Can you tell me how you spell...
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
What sort have you got?
What...?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
What?
What kids?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
I’ll call again.
Got it. Puppies.
La what?
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
I hope it’s not too significant.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Jah...
Is my money in there?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
Should I come back in five minutes?
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Shut up!
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Er... Yes...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
If you can, send me a receipt.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
So... pretend it's not a game.
Yes, my lord.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
Yes...
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Tell me...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
I want to stay with you...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I -- I don't understand...
I'm staying, Jean.
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Scared of a girl?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not long ago...
Yes.
No... I want to be confessed.
And may I go to Mass?
You have nothing to regret...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
His face.
That's not a lot.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
He's on the other side of the river.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Damn right!
Me too...
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Perfectly.
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
The clothes are not important...
No...!
Here -- take this instead.
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Playing...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Yes... lots of things!
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
In His name??
Really?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I need to confess again.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Who wants me to stop?
Yes.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Wladek, please.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Dead.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
I haven't seen him.
Who's recruiting?
Yes, please.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
We use what?
Just shut up.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You're out, aren't you?
Hungry.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
You made contact?
It's a little cut, nothing.
No, I don't think so?
Not yet.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Yes, like a cave.
... without a shred of manners.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
Yes, it's unholy.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I don't want to learn.
Spoken words?
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
That's right.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
What's the line on Visitation?
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
What do we do?
Here.
You think my play is bad?
What?
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We'll be waitin'.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
What about the other one?
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Why?
He threatened to kill me.
I thought I'd lost him.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
But I got a train to make.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
Where's June today?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Yeh, this time anyway.
You move right along, don't ya.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
All right, when?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
Then why the rat?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You got a system, Carver?
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Let me talk to him.
Don't think I know him.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
No.
Is that what it means?
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Another young man.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Give it to me.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
There!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Macaulay.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Which way did she fall?
Forgive me.  How are you?
Yes, she would.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
No.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
I see.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
I guess all the suspects are here.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
What bonds?
Don't you remember....
You're going to return every cent of it!
Never mind.
I trust you.
No.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
That's jolly.
Maybe a drink would help you.
They were kidding you.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Someone get a doctor.
I'll get some towels. 
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Well, didn't you?
You did.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Who's that?
Yes.
You talk as if I were Asta.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Huh?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Sure.
Couple of months anyway.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
I don't know.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
I know I left them there.
Maybe she has.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I'm fired.
It's a fortune box.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
We're going to keep driving.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I heard!
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Why'd he come in our camp.
You said he was a deserter.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
No.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Blow me.
There might be something in there.
OH MY GOD!
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
Oh, that's fun.
Wh-what do you think--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Wes is dead!
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Sure.
Damn.
It's got to be going better than this..
Probably.
Shi'ites, I think.
Then I'm a rich man.
Yeah.
Really?
I could use some recon photos too.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I thought it would be good to know.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Yeah, you're funny.
What!?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
You know what I'm doing with my half?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Yeah, well, we're not.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Violation?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Eat your dinner.
Don't go.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Looks like dirt.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What?
What?
You don't know.  You don't....
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
No one can see us now we're alone.
No!...No!...
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
THX and me.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
What?
But you can't...you.
No, I...
Look more closely.
What kind of answer is that?
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No......  She's dead THX........
What do you want?
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
Where are they?
No thanks, Bev.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Mike Reilly.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
I don't know. You tell me?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Look, it's a longshot...
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Right.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Easy, guys.  
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
Reilly! He's loaded!
Alex-
Stay in the truck.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Look who's talking, old man.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Diamonds all over.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
I thought so.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
I've got to see you.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
What is it?
What do you mean?
M'sieu Monescu!
Now just a minute, Major--
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Thank you.
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Lily!
Yes.
Yes.
I know that niche.
Oh!
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
You're hired!
How do you like my dress?
Hair?
Good night.
Talk? About me--about us?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>Adolph</u>?
And you expect me to believe that?
Giron...!
Goodbye.
Divine ...
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes, madame!
Please!  Thank you.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
For all the really important things--
I don't want your money!
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
Don't drop it Rose.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
So do I.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Not the better half.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Sure. Count me in.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
You're welcome. Rose.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
Just move with me. Don't think.
Jack, I --
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
Would you like anything?
Just tell us what you can --
You had it the entire time?!
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I can explain--
We'll save you a place at our table.
Isn't that interesting?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Want to take it back?
I'll say she is!
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
At seven-thirty?
Sorry.
You said it! How about a little action?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Shortie, look!
How're the tips?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Now you're talkin'!
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
I'll take one. 
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Why, I--
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
What'll I say?
Sure.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
She's in New York.
I was never stiffer in my life.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Is this your gun?
I'll never love anybody else.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
Meaning what?
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
The country boy's about due.
About twelve hundred.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Why?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
What's the matter?
Let me look at it.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Isn't that a daisy?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Nice voice.
Not now.  I don't have time.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
I don't understand.
Beauty, ain't he?
Come and get him.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
No...
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Here it come: one-two-
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
But who was the Devil?
Ignore her?
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
That's great coming from you.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Sorry...
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I don't.
What was that all about?
There's no reasoning with him.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
You'd die for fun?
Where do you get these questions?
Wyatt...
Wait!
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
What're you talkin' about?
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
But she doted on the frowner
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
I'm sorry.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
I appreciate your time -
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
- We all want what we can't have?
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Nothing.
Do you?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
How is old Q?
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
I hope so.
What?
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
... We have time for that?
Don't say it.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
I understand.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
It doesn't quite add up.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No -
What's wrong?
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
...I see.
Fueled and waiting.
Get more men up there!
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Who is it?
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Junior spends time with his child.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Like a veil has been lifted?
You were in hell?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
No, I'm too hot now.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
You should go back and rest.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Okay...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Bye, house.
What?  What is it?
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
What?!
Look out!!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
We're not aiming for the truck!
How 'bout three out of five?
Murderer!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
Oh no, Hannah!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
You murdering dog!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Yes SIR!
Uh-oh.
Sid!!!
No, Slink --
Speed up!
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Home is where the heart is.
Get away from me...
I've got a present for you...
It was only a mouthful!
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Juliet who?
Victoria -
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Nine thousand dollars.
Arnie, this is crazy.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
Carl --
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
So's the video camera.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Depends on the state.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
We're playing!
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
Yes, sir!
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Something.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
The police won't find your car.
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
What is it you want me to do?
But will he be house-trained?
It's possible.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Any idea how much?
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I don't know what to say.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What?
think I left something back at the -
Easy for you to say.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Eh? How's that?
Oh, really?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No.
Aye.
Yeah.
Nightmare.
Another dab?
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
What about The Untouchables?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Four Grand.
We're two thousand short.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Your usual table, sir?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
No joy yet.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
He doubts me.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Rescued at last.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
A Federation starship.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Put it on the screen.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Goodnight, Bones.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Who is it he reminds you of?
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is what possible?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
A "t."
Hmmm?
It must be all those marsh melons.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I'm afraid of nothing.
No conditions.




Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
No. You must kill me.
No. I will not.
I belong here.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
Uh... got any cinnamon?
You call that getting over it?
That Dillinger's on to him.
For being on to Dillinger.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Hello, Alan.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Right on the money!
Yes, okay, exactement!
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
You wouldn't dare.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Wrote the...?
It's too far!
Alan-One...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Come here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
We have to.
I had to...in the games...
As long as it gets us out of here
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Simon?  Ohmygod.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, right.
In the helicopter.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
No way.  Not Dana.
In her dreams.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Stay on him.
I still don't believe it.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
Sorry.
I wasn't cheating!
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Yes what?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
My husband the hero.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
No.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
What?
No.  Much more.
And you've got one.
So what's your angle?
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Use 'em and lose 'em.
What about the husbands?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Yes.  Now go.
What is it you need me to do?
I'm married!
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Knock wood.
You can't have just one.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Now hang up.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Is that your real name? Really?
There's nothing to tell.
What's your favorite movie star?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Almost four years.
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Uh-huh.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Really?
How come?
Cancoon.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Take that shit somewhere else.
You wanna get unhaunted?
No thanks.
Ask him if he got the letter.
You goin' out?
I certainly hope so.
Tell me.
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
How 'bout me what?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
He trusts you?
No.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
I bullshitted him.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
What?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
I'm your son.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Do tell. Why drug related?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Uh-huh.
Sure was.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
You're no longer an extra -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
How the fuck could he know?
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Rock whores.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Yeah, I live here.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
What are you going to do with us?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Meaning...???
No.
I have to go.
Underground.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
James, why don't we...?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
You're sure?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I'm not crazy.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
How did you find me?
Yes, sir.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
You want something?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
How much.
You Harlin?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just a car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Hundred-fifty.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
You got beer?
Yes.  Yes it is.
Who the hell is this!?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
May I carry your package, Grace?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
Come here.
Like you.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Where?
From?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
There has to be!
What about him?
Not me.  Us.
Now what?
But I want to say with you,
What for?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
I'm her husband.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
How do you know if you've never tried?
Just ran into a little trouble.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
How do you put a price on murder?
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
And tell her what?
Is the job done?
Trouble with the car again?
Liar.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Christ, Jake, please--
You're not talking sense.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
I've had time to get over it.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
You expect me to believe that?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Jesus!
I guess.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Eh?
You want something?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Stand up.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Bobby Cooper.
An overheated car.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Like you don't know.
About things.  About your wife.
I did?
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
And what does that make you?
You love her, but you hate her?
That's a bit much.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
No!
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Open up!
It's Grace.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Come here.
Like you.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
How do you know he's still not here?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could leave him.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
I'm sorry...
Is it pretty?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Bobby? Are you all right?
Can you make it back up?
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
But, in particular?
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Oh?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
No baby, you got it wrong.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I said come on!
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
Yes.
I have a lock on the door.
What does that mean?
No that's it.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
What was your idea Elijah?
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
Like what?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
You're skill.
Just one--
I'll help you.
No.
Jeremy listen to what--
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
How did you get together?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
We was... lyin'.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Advances?
You want... a free one.
No?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Oh.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
What happened, did you hit him?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yup.
First one what?
Lemmee see it.
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah?
Two weeks, I guess.
Sally?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Best we move that pig.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
The Kid, yeah...
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Who said that?
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We'll bury him.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Just forget about it.
Goddamnit.
Alright.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
County. I was in for fraud.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
If you'll just let me -
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
You okay?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Just do what I tell you.
What time is it?
This I had to see myself.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
We'll see.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Kobayashi.
I just want to hear your story.
He didn't have my lawyer.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
No.
I'm not a rat.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
Why didn't you say anything?
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Very good.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Yes.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
You've just said you signed it.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I thought I would need it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...I made a reservation at...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
No, you did fine.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
... that's perfectly all right.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
I've got to work.
Stop pressuring me...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
What do you want?
...I'm going to need your help...
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
We got to talk.
I don't know.
I don't want a mistrial.
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
In New York?
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
We, we were rather busy...
Huh.  And why is that?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
I -- I --
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
You're not far wrong.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
Why?
Dinner... and what else?
Because I remind you of her?
Okay.
Tomorrow morning.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Wherever you'd like...
Oh, yeah. There.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Where had you been before?
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Oh! Yes! Here!
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
What?
We have.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Only silence. It's always like this.
No!
Yesterday.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm here, I've got you...
All the time.
Yes?! But --
No, never!
Please answer my question.
How long has she had the room?
What car?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
It wasn't your fault.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Ah, Johnny-O...
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
How?
Okay.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Oh?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
But you said grey, sir.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
I didn't hear you.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
She's dead.
Why was the floor wet?
It's sacrilegious.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
You want to hear me out?
What are you talking about?
Why?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Just giving the facts.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
So I didn't fucking do it!
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
I can't do this.
They're driving me nuts!
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Good God...Good God...
What you just said. Say it again.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
What does that mean?
You hate women.
True.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
They need leadership.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
I don't think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's quiet.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
With all my heart.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
Are they fighting?
Can we just talk this out?
I won't even discuss it.
No.
No it's not okay. It's not.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
But...
What does that mean?
Like how?
Move the bodies.
You did all right dad.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
I love you dad.
About what?
He's your brother.
The wahoo?
That's what I'm thinking.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
I do.
A mutant species.
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Yes, yes.
It's a present from my parents.
Two.
What's that?
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Whatever you like.
Wasn't that cowardice?
Don't go!
You must listen to me before you go.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Yes, sir.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Fifteen yards.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
He was asking for it.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
What are you going to do?
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Do they worry you that much, then?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
How much do you want for him?
What's he called?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Where?
This louse is looking for trouble.
When you are, miss.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
I have a headache.
Me? What did I do?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Catch him and your record's clean.
I don't know.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
I've seen worse.
If you can catch him.
Their weapons missing?
Then I guess we're even.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Not from in here.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
He hears...everything.
Do I get to see it or not?
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
What's wrong with Parker?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
All my work is my finest.
That's not true, Parker.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
I'm still working on it.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
As a matter of fact, it is.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Start of what?
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Duck!
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
For Schumann.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Indeed it is.
...and...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Anything at the Airport?
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>So</u> forth...
Due in Nashville.
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...

No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
...what are we going to do...?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...we own it?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
...what is this?
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Who're you working for?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
...that's what it is.
Because.
I'm sure they do.
"Freedom."
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.

Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Of what?
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...givem what they want...But...
Is he dead?
Get on your feet, boy.

They'll be here in ten minutes.
No.  You're right.
A proud tradition.
It's too clean.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...

What about tipping off Yurovich?
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Start unloading.
...Work okay?
About what?
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
Allright. Wait here...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
Excuse me.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
Yeah, almost...
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It's over you, Gordon.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Thank you
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
What?  Tony and China, together?
That's not what you said last night.
Safety in numbers man.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Mom.
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
It's only two hours away.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
No, he wouldn't.
That's not true.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
You're joking.
What does she look like?
Yes, but...
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Have you been hurt?
Almost.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
And then you weren't there.
Very much.
Um...sure.
Yeah.
Claire.
...just so she could cut them off.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
The planchette?
Why?
If she was dangerous before--
I know.
Did he say that?
I don't know...
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Norman Spencer.
Don't.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
I am, really.
You are...
I know.
Tomorrow.
After that.
To make sure she's all right.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Unless you need me to come home...
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Really?
Wow.
Well, that's nice.
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you call about the Feurs?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
I will NOT.
Then where is she?
I felt you...looking through me...
You told me that I was...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
STOP IT!
What's the matter?
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
She can't be here without me.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
MADISON!
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
What are you talk---
Then you wear it.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
'He'...?
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Rowan...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Rowan...

Mad. for each other.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
- a witch.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
That's cause we're below sea level.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
I think I will pass...
No she didn't...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Did you?
Then make it stop...
You killed my friend!
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Oh...
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Maybe he got promoted.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
These are real, live women?
God, I love being dead.
Yeah?
Yeah? You like?
You have changed since second grade.
It's my private business! Mine!
Of course we are.
I guess.
Yeah.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Just say it, Dad.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Got it.
Whatever you want.
Of course we were.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
You mean they knew who I was?
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
It's not up to me.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Me-ow.
Your article sucked.
I'm trying to help.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
He didn't. He had it built.
I doubt it.
It's incredibly simple.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
That's refreshingly deviant.
I'm very aural.
That's hard to believe.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
I'll make you very proud.
Like what?
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
As much as possible.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Tipping?
Me? The King of Coitus?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
And where might that be?
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Suzie?
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Just check out the car.
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
He dropped Jimmy off first?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Just tell us what happened.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
Yeah... okay... he did
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
What?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Curiosity, I guess.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Whichever one I want.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
I miss Dad.
Yes.  God, Mom...
Yes.
Hello.
You think that's wise?
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I did.  At Blue Balls.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
That's cop bullshit.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
I'll work on it.
What about the explosive?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I'm going to hit you.
What way is that?
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
It's not a guy...
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Where have you been?
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
But it only has six legs.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Fine, I'll stop.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
That would be... the Mexican War?
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Who was this partner of his?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Let me see it.
Why not?
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good.  How long will it take?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Where the hell did you come from?
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
Who?
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
His will.
There's nobody here.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
He never misses.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Shut up.
Who is he?
How are we going to get out there?
The sorceress.
Sorry. It's important.
John, I don't understand any of this.
It's been a while.
Yes, sir.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Who else knows?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
No.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
What?
You tell him. When you're able.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I know what he said.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Say again?
Wrong.
He's got my number.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
His name is John Book.
That is idle talk.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
All right, where is he?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Yes, darling.
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Do you presume to criticize the....
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Hickory!
Catch him, you fool!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Whenever you wish.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
How did you guess?
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh -- yes.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Has it poppies on the wall....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Did you say something?
Oh --!
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Oh, come on.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
They would?
Yes -- that's true.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
What?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Who at?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Ohhhh -- it's me!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
No, sir!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Dorothy!
We'll get you together!
Oh --
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
We can’t.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I was the one who brought that money in...
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Who did you get it from?
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I’m sorry.
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
We’re alright.
You’re not going to.
No. You’ll be safe here.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Soon she’ll be everywhere.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
How appropriate.
Bond!
Please.
Of course...
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Washington?
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Collect me?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
We should get back --  What?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
Then why don't you ask him?!?
Am I free to go?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
We're not after car thieves here.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Naturally.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
That's would be me.
They come in any other styles or colors?
I thought that was in detail.
Here we go again.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
This is a gift. From me to you.
Had to do what I had to do.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
I don't like him being here.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
You know, you --
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
By reading my thoughts?
Were you now?
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Senator?
Gosh, I hope so.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
If she held on any longer she could have.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
What do you mean to do?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Now wait a minute!
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.
Baack!
Oh, nice.
Surprised!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Fron kon steen!
Break that old man's violin.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
No, Fred ereck.
I'm sure we will.
What hump?
Wockers with the knockers???
I have a pretty good idea.
If you like -- just hurry!
Tonight?
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
... I'm glad that's...
How do you know it was a 'he'?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
That sound good, boss.
It's alive!
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
And look at this, Doctor!
Me?  Sing?
Are you serious??
I see what you mean.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Yes.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Food!!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Which one?
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
